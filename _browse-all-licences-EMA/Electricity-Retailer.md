<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p>Required for the retail of electricity to contestable customers</p>
<p>Retail electricity licensees (electricity retailers) are entities authorised by the Energy Market Authority (EMA) to retail electricity to contestable customers.</p>
<p>There are two types of electricity retailers: Market Participant Retailers (MPRs) and Non-Market Participant Retailers (NMPRs).</p>
<p>MPRs have to be registered with the Energy Market Company (EMC) to purchase electricity from the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) to sell to contestable consumers.</p>
<p>NMPRs need not register with EMC to participate in the NEMS, as they will purchase electricity indirectly from the NEMS through the Market Support Services Licensee (MSSL).</p>
<p>For more information on becoming a retailer, you may refer to EMA's Guide to Becoming a Licensed Electricity Retailer available via <a href="https://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Licensees/Electricity_Licensing/Retailer/Guide-for-Prospective-Retailers-updated-Oct2020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.ema.gov.sg/cmsmedia/Licensees/Electricity_Licensing/Retailer/Guide-for-Prospective-Retailers-updated-Oct2020.pdf</a>.</p>
<p>A new electricity retailer applicant will need to first apply for a provisional licence which is valid for 1 year. During this period, the licensee shall need to fulfil the stipulated requirements needed to apply for a full electricity retailer licence. A full electricity retailer licence will be granted upon fulfilment of the stipulated requirements prior to the expiry of the provisional licence. For more information regarding the requirements, you may refer to the Open Electricity Market's website (<a href="https://www.openelectricitymarket.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.openelectricitymarket.sg</a>).</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Does the licence guarantee a registration to the Market Company?</strong><br>
The issuance of a licence does not guarantee your registration as a market participant by the Market Company</li>
<li><strong>Are there any requirements to be met?</strong><br>
Please note the following two requirements to be met by each retailer after being issued an Electricity Retailer Licence before it can commence retailing electricity:<br><br>
<u>Requirement 1:</u>Pass the Market Trial conducted by SP Group. For more information, please refer to the Open Electricity Market's website (<a href="https://www.openelectricitymarket.sg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.openelectricitymarket.sg</a>); and
<br><br>
<u>Requirement 2:</u>Satisfy EMA's requirements for participation in the Open Electricity Market. For more information, please email EMA_MDSD@ema.gov.sg.
<br><br>
Retailers who only meet Requirement 1 (i.e., passed the Market Trial conducted by SP Group) can only retail electricity to business consumers with an average monthly consumption of at least 2MWh.
<br><br>
Retailers must meet both requirements before they can start retailing electricity to (i) business consumers with an average monthly consumption of less than 2MWh, and (ii) all residential consumers.</li></ol>

<strong>Additional Information</strong>
