<li><strong>I need more details about import and export licence. Where may I find it?</strong><br />In most cases, import and export licences, i.e. L7A/B, L8A/B and N4A/B, are to be applied through the TradeNet system by freight companies which handle the transportation of cargoes from one Country/Region to another.<br /><br />Before the applications for import and export licences are submitted through TradeNet, vendors / suppliers should ensure that their dealer licences, i.e. L1, L2 or N1 are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus or radioactive material, and that they have obtained the relevant possession licence if the apparatus is for use at their premises.<br /><br />For direct import / export (not through a vendor / supplier), import and export licences can be applied through GoBusiness Licensing.
