<p><strong>Which clinic should I go to get the medical check-up done?</strong><br />Please bring the medical certificate form to a local medical clinic.

Please ensure that the doctor has indicated whether or not you are fit to engage in radiation work before you leave the clinic. You are advised to keep a copy of the medical form for your own reference. Please note that L5, L6 licences and R1 certificate holders in the NDT industry will need to undertake a blood test annually, and submit the test results to NEA during the renewal of the licences. This annual test is generally not compulsory for workers who are not in the NDT industry.</p>
