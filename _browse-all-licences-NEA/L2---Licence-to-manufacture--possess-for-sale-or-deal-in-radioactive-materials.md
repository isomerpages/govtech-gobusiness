<p><strong>I need more details about import and export licence. Where may I find it?</strong><br />In most cases, import and export licences, i.e. L7A/B, L8A/B and N4A/B, are to be applied through the TradeNet system by freight companies which handle the transportation of cargoes from one Country/Region to another. Hence, these licenses are not the main concern of the importers/exporters. Instead, the importers/exporters should ensure that their dealer licences, i.e. L1 or L2 are valid and have been updated to include the irradiating apparatus or radioactive material, and that they have obtained the relevant possession licence if the apparatus is for use at their premises. For more information on the items under import and export control, please refer to the following links:<br /><a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/about-us/national-single-window/tradenet/competent-authorities-requirements-for-controlled-items/national-environment-agency---radiation-protection-and-nuclear-science-department-rpnsd">https://www.customs.gov.sg/about-us/national-single-window/tradenet/competent-authorities-requirements-for-controlled-items/national-environment-agency---radiation-protection-and-nuclear-science-department-rpnsd </a><br /><br /><a href="https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/appendix-c---items-under-import-export-control.pdf">https://www.customs.gov.sg/-/media/cus/files/about-us/annexes-and-appendices/appendix-c---items-under-import-export-control.pdf</a><br /><br /></p>

<li>
<p><strong>What other approval is needed in order to supply or possess a medical device?</strong><br />Medical devices are controlled under the Health Products Act administered by the Health Science Authority (HSA). Radiation emitting medical equipment are required to be registered and/or authorised by HSA before the equipment can be supplied in Singapore. Your company should check with <a href="http://www.hsa.gov.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MDB/ HSA</a> concurrently to find out the relevant requirements when you are preparing for the radiation licence application. Certain types of radiation emitting equipment may only be possessed by medical and/or healthcare establishments, and may only be used by registered medical and healthcare professionals at places registered with the Ministry of Health.</p>
