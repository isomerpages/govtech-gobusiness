You are advised to keep a copy of the medical form for your own reference. Please note that L5, L6 licences and R1 certificate holders in the NDT industry will need to undertake a blood test annually, and submit the test results to NEA during the renewal of the licences.

The L5 and L6 licensees are required to return their TLD cards and those of their workers (who hold the R1 certificate) to RPNSD for analysis. All previously issued TLD cards must be returned to RPNSD within two weeks upon the reception of new TLD cards. Note that a fee of $54.60 will be charged to the licensee for each loss/damage TLD card. There are special requirements for the use of ionising radiation in NDT work.
