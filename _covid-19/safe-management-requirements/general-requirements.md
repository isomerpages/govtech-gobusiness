## General requirements

To ensure a safe working environment, businesses are required to abide by the [nation-wide general requirements for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Businesses are also required to adhere to the [sector-specific requirements](/safemanagement/sector/), and comply with [measures to facilitate contact tracing](/safemanagement/safeentry/).

All businesses should take note of the following:

- From 1 January 2022, up to 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

- From 14 February 2022, workers will need to have taken a booster dose to maintain their fully vaccinated status beyond 270 days from the last dose in their primary vaccination series. From 15 January 2022, workers who are not fully vaccinated are not to enter the workplace, even with a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result.

- There should continue to be no cross-deployment of workers to multiple worksites.

- Social gatherings at the workplace will continue to be disallowed.

- Employers should continue to stagger start times of employees who need to return to the workplace and implement flexible working hours.

- Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. Employers may check their company's vaccination rate through [The Workforce Vaccination Checker](https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} (Corppass login required).
