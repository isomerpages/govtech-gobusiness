## Time-Limited 8-weeks Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for workplaces

As more employees return to the workplace from 1 Jan 2022, there could be higher risk of workplace transmission, particularly given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant. To ensure early detection and ringfencing of COVID-19 infections, we encourage all firms to implement regular testing for all employees. The Government will therefore conduct <b>a second round of Antigen Rapid Test (ART) kit distribution to workplaces</b>. Similar to the first round of distribution in Sep/Oct 2021, this time-limited 8-weeks RRT exercise is voluntary and will be on an application basis. Application will open from 3 January 2022 through to 31 January 2022. Firms who have applied for and have utilised the test kits from the first round of distribution may still apply for this second round of kits distribution.

Firms with eligible employees (see eligibility criteria below) may apply for 8 ART kits per employee for weekly testing over a two-month period. These tests can be self-administered by the employee either at home, or at the work premises.

### [Round 2 of Time-Limited RRT] Eligibility Criteria

- Staff should be fully vaccinated, and not be on any mandatory Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) or Fast and Easy Testing (FET) RRT
    - Companies may apply for ART kits for staff who are (i) certified to be medically ineligible (please refer to [MOH website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/default-document-library/annex-bb44528cbc27b4ceb9571fb222a0c5777.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the conditions to be met before one can be certified as medically ineligible), or (ii) unvaccinated and recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days as of 31 Mar 2022). 
    - Companies should not apply kits for non-fully vaccinated staff, as well as staff on mandatory RRT regime.
- Staff should physically return to office, worksite or any off-site premises at least once a week, for work purposes (i.e. does not work from home full-time). This includes staff on hybrid work arrangements and who will return to office. Staff who are on 100% work from home arrangement would not qualify for the kits.
    - Includes full-time and part-time employees, regular vendors/contractors, students on long-term (at least 2 months) placement or internship.

Companies are required to commence weekly testing with immediate effect, upon receipt of the ART kits. 


### Compliance & Results Declaration

Firms that have applied for and received the ART kits are required to have processes in place to ensure that tests are conducted properly every week for all onsite employees, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up protocols are adhered to. Firms should retain proof of such processes and test results, and to produce these proof when audited by the government. 

Firms are required to submit their ART results declaration at the end of each monthâ€™s testing cycle (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the government. The Government shall have the right to claw back the cost of any test kits should any of the information submitted in the application form or results declaration form are found to be untrue, or if any non-compliance to the testing requirements are found.

For firms who have applied and received the ART kits for the first round of Time-Limited kit distribution in September/October 2021, they should submit the ART results declaration via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration](https://go.gov.sg/time-limited-rrt-art-results-declaration){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} For firms who may have discontinued or deferred testing due to full work-from-home arrangements announced by the Government in end-Sep 2021, they should still submit any test results they had collected (or relevant justification if there are no test results) at the end of each month for the two-months period starting from the date of receipt of kits. Companies are advised to re-commence testing upon return to office and continue submitting results on a monthly basis until testing is complete.   

Firms who have applied and received the ART kits for the first round of Time-Limited kit distribution in September/October 2021 may have discontinued or deferred testing due to full work-from-home arrangements announced by the Government in end-Sep 2021. In such cases, firms should still submit any test results they had collected (or relevant justification if there are no test results) at the end of each month for the two-months period starting from the date of receipt of kits.
