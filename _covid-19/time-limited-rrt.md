## Time-Limited 8-weeks Weekly Routine Testing (RRT) for workplaces

<b>Please note that the application for Round 2 of the Time-Limited Kits Distribution has closed.</b> Firms who have applied and received their ART kits are to commence weekly testing, and are reminded to <b>submit the ART results declaration</b> at the end of each month’s testing cycle (i.e. twice across the 8-weeks period) to the Government via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions](https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

Note: The stepdown of mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) for higher-risk workplaces (except sectors interacting with vulnerable population and essential services) as announced in the 16 Feb MTF Press Release <b>does not</b> apply to the time-limited 8-weeks weekly testing at workplaces i.e. companies who applied and received kits under this Round 2 of time-limited kits distribution should continue weekly testing of eligible employees and report their test results to the Government until all the test kits received are fully utilised.

### Delivery of Kits

Successful applicants will be informed of their delivery up to 10 working days from the time of complete application. However, applications made after 21 Jan onwards may experience a longer processing and delivery lead time. For enquiries regarding delivery, you may send in an enquiry via this [form](https://go.gov.sg/tlrrt-round-2-delivery-enquiry){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

Companies are required to commence weekly testing with immediate effect, upon receipt of the ART kits. These tests can be self-administered by the employee either at home, or at the work premises. 


### Compliance & Results Declaration

Firms that have applied for and received the ART kits are expected to comply by the following:

- **Only applied for test kits on behalf of employees who meet the eligibility criteria** (i.e. fully vaccinated, work onsite, and not under mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) regime). 

- **Submit their ART results declaration at the end of each month’s testing cycle** (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the government via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions](https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

- **Have processes in place** to ensure that tests are conducted properly every week for all onsite employees, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up protocols are adhered to. Firms should retain relevant proof of such records and processes until 30 Apr 2022, and to produce this proof when audited by the government. 


The Government shall have the right to claw back the cost of any test kits should there be any late submissions of results, or if any of the information submitted in the application form or results declaration form are found to be untrue, or if any non-compliance to the testing requirements is found.
