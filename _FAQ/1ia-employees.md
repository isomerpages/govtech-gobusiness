#### **1. How do I know if my foreign workers can leave their residence for work?**
You can now use the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app to check if your foreign employees can leave their residence (dormitory or non-dormitory housing) for work. The status of your employees' AccessCode takes into account 3 broad parameters:
- Their health
- Their residential address
- Whether your company and/or worker is allowed to resume work

They can only leave for work if their AccessCode is 'Green' (can go out for work).
However, if their AccessCode is 'Red' (cannot go out for work), they are not allowed to leave for work.

#### **2. Am I able to access all my workers' AccessCode status and details, instead of checking individually using the SGWorkPass?**
From 12 July 2020, employers can download the AccessCode details of their workers from a new <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work" target="_blank">Safe@Work eService</a>. For a start, AccessCode statuses of workers who hold a Work Permit or S Pass will be available. Downloading the AccessCode details for Employment Pass holders will be available in the near future.

Please refer to the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/safe-work" target="_blank">Safe@Work eService</a> onboarding guide for more information.

#### **3. My worker's AccessCode is 'Red' and his AccessCode details shows 'No approval to start work'. What should I do?**
This means your company has not been given approval to operate, and/or your workers are not allowed to start work.

All companies should check the <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/" target="_blank">GoBusiness Portal</a> to find out if they are allowed to resume operations. If your workers’ AccessCode status is reflected as ‘GREY’ (AccessCode does not apply) even though you are permitted to operate, please approach your respective lead agencies for assistance.

					<li>Your project did not include the worker in the submission for approval</li>

#### **4. How do I update my foreign employee’s residential address?**
You can update their residential address using:
- <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ofwas" target="_blank">Online Foreign Worker Address Service (OFWAS)</a> for Work Permit holders
- <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/eservices/services/ep-online" target="_blank">EP Online</a> for Employment Pass and S Pass holders

Their AccessCode will be refreshed 1 - 2 days after their addresses are updated in OFWAS or EP Online. If their AccessCode is not refreshed, it may mean:
- Your worker has failed to scan the QR code in his room using the FWMOMCare App; or
- the dormitory operators' record is not updated. Please contact the dormitory operator to rectify this.

#### **5. Is company-based training allowed?**
Company-based training is allowed for firms that are permitted to resume operations.  Companies are reminded to comply all existing Safe Distancing measures during training.

#### **6. I have been told to ramp up production during this time period but cannot find additional manpower, how do I source for employees during this time?**
MOM has partnered with the Singapore Business Federation to offer a temporary scheme that allows companies in all sectors to hire existing WPHs (who are in Singapore) from other sectors, with the agreement of their current employers. 

Companies can also hire existing WPHs from their own or another sector, where the work permits are within 40 days of expiry. This is an extension of a scheme that exists for the construction and process sectors for transfers within their own sectors. Agreement from the current employer is not needed. 

Hiring firms will be required to meet the prevailing criteria under their respective sectors. This temporary scheme will be in place for five months until 31 August 2020. 

For inter-sectoral transfers (earlier than 40 days before work permit expiry), firms can approach SBF at <a href = "mailto: manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg">manpowerconnect@sbf.org.sg</a> or visit their website for more information. For transfer of WPHs from 40 days before work permit expiry (including inter-sectorial transfers), firms can submit their request via an online form or visit MOM’s website for more information.

#### **7. What can employees of firms which are not allowed to resume service do, if they are told to leave the company due to refusal to report to work?**
Employees who have been wrongfully dismissed may file a claim against the wrongful dismissal or make a phone advisory appointment with the <a href="https://www.tal.sg/tadm/eServices" target="_blank">Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management (TADM)</a>.

For more information on what constitutes a wrongful dismissal, please refer to the <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/termination-of-employment/unfair-dismissal#what-is-a-wrongful-dismissal" target="_blank">Tripartite Guidelines on Wrongful Dismissal</a>.

#### **8. Are workers staying in dormitories allowed to take public transport?**
As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.
More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **9. Can my workers who are staying in dormitories walk or take their own personal transport (e.g. bicycle, motorcycles) to and from their worksites?**
As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.

If the worksite is located nearby (e.g. <1km away) and there are no community areas en-route, you can allow your worker to walk or cycle.

When allowing workers to walk or cycle between dormitories and worksites, you must demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request by enforcement officers. You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, and that they only travel to and from their worksites with no stops in between.

Workers are not allowed to ride motorcycles to and from their worksites under any circumstances.

More details on implementing safe management measures for workers on employer-provided transportation can be found <a href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-safe-management-measures-for-workers-on-transportation" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **10. Can my workers who are staying in dormitories take taxis or private hire vehicles (e.g. Grab, GoJek) to and from their worksites?**
As an employer, you must provide transport for your workers to and from their worksites.
You can use taxis or private hire vehicles (PHVs) as long as you:
- Work with taxi or PHV operators to pre-arrange and pre-pay for such vehicles to ferry the workers to ensure availability of vehicles and reduce physical interactions between drivers and workers.
- Work with dormitory operators to plan and coordinate pick-up times so as to reduce congestion.
AND
- Are able to demonstrate that you have complied with the relevant safe management measures upon request.

You must ensure that your workers wear their masks at all times, check in using SafeEntry, and that they go directly to and from their worksites with no stops in between.
