#### **12. Will it be recommended/mandatory to install acrylic partitions for employees’ work stations, and for front office counter?**
As a Safe Management Measure, there should be clear physical spacing of at least one metre between persons at all times at the workplace premises. Employers must demarcate safe physical distances (at least one metre apart) at the workplace premises with visual indicators or through physical means (e.g. high barriers, relocation of workstations). This must also be applied to common spaces such as lifts, pantries, meeting rooms and hotel lobbies. Hotels are required to comply with this requirement; however, hotels can determine the most appropriate method to ensure compliance depending on the operating context and environment. For e.g. if the front office counters are mobile and physically placed widely apart, there is no need to install acrylic partitions.
