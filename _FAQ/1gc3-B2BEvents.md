#### **1. What constitutes a MICE event?**
For the purpose of the expansion of MICE pilot events announced on 7 September 2020, MICE events refer to business-oriented meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions which excludes work-related events such as conferences, seminars, corporate retreats, Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) that are targeted at internal audiences such as employees as well as other events which are predominantly social in nature.

#### **2. When will MICE events be allowed to resume? Can I apply to do so?**
In line with the safe and gradual resumption of economic activities in Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will start accepting applications for organisers to pilot Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE)  events of up to 250 attendees from 1 October 2020. STB and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will review all MICE event proposals, and event organisers may proceed only upon obtaining MTI’s approval. More details will be released at a later stage.

#### **3. What will happen if EOs fail to comply with the framework, is it an offence?**
Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act passed in Parliament on 7 April 2020, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. Repeat offenders may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both. Further, other levers under the Act, such as closure of the premises, may be used against attractions that are found to be non-compliant.

Businesses that do not comply with the Government’s required SMMs may also be ineligible for government grants, loans, tax rebates and other assistance.
