#### **1. Why is the manpower submission requirement for Marine & Offshore and Process sectors different?**
From 1 July 2020, businesses that fall under the Marine & Offshore and Process sectors will be required to submit details of the employees/workers <a href="https://go.gov.sg/essentialworkers" target="_blank">here</a>. This submission of manpower details is required to facilitate information updates for the AccessCode on the SGWorkPass app, including the approval to work and the requirement for regular swabbing. Failure to do so will cause the employee/worker's SGWorkPass AccessCode status to reflect as “Red”.

#### **2. What manpower details must I submit, and from when should I be submitting?**
You will need to submit the FIN/NRICs of your workers/employees that are working on-site, and the maximum number of workers on site at any given time. If your workers are working on-site, you will also need to provide the address of the work premises, and indicate whether the work premises is a production site (e.g. shipyards/ production plant) or non-production site (e.g. other workplaces/ office premise). Please note that workers deployed at production sites will be required to undergo **Rostered Routine Testing (RRT)**.

For workers and employees that are working from home, who subsequently need to go back to site for specific reasons, you will need to submit their FIN/NRIC details.

Only the details for Singapore Citizens, Singapore Permanent Residents, Employment Pass Holders, S Pass Holders and Work Permit Holders are required to be submitted. All other non-MOM work pass holders (e.g. long-term visitor pass or ICA work pass) need not be submitted. 

#### **3. What is considered a production site?**
Production site is defined as areas where shipbuilding/ship repair, process maintenance and construction activities are carried out. Examples of production sites includes shipyards, process plants, refineries and fabrication workshops.

#### **4. If my office is located within my production site, how should I indicate so in my manpower submission?**
If the office staff do not come into contact with the production site workers and are clearly segregated, you can indicate your premises as a non-production site.

#### **5. If my worker/employees are deployed across multiple sites, how do I indicate so when submitting my manpower details?**
You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of your workers/employees that are deployed across multiple sites.

#### **6. If my company has multiple work premises, do I need to submit manpower details for all my workers across all the different work premises?**
You will need to click on the “Add Premises” button to key in the details of all your company’s work premises.

#### **7. Will I receive any additional notification to know whether my worker/employee is approved to work on-site? How do I know if my submitted manpower is approved to work on-site?**
Upon submission of the manpower details, you will receive an email acknowledgement. The AccessCode on SGWorkPass app will determine whether your submitted manpower is allowed to work on site. The AccessCode will factor in a few parameters, namely:
- Worker’s health status 
- Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free
- Worker’s approval to work
- Download and activate latest version of TraceTogether

Workers with a “green” AccessCode will be allowed to work on-site.

#### **8. By when should I submit my manpower details to know whether my worker/employee will be allowed to work on-site?**
You will need to submit your manpower details by 1730 hours, for your worker/employees’ AccessCode to be updated by 2359 hours on the following day via the SGWorkPass app.

#### **9. What happens if the employee/workers’ AccessCode is not updated?**
If you have submitted your manpower details by 1730 hours, your employee/workers’ AccessCode will only be updated by 2359 hours on the following day. If you require assistance, please write to MTI at <a href = "mailto: covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg">covid_gobusiness@mti.gov.sg</a>.

#### **10. When do I need to update my manpower details submission?**
You will need to update your manpower details as soon as there is a change in the specific workers required to work on-site, as this will affect arrangements for your workers’ regular swab tests.

#### **11. My SSIC code is in Marine/Offshore/Process but that is not the nature of my work. Do I still have to submit my manpower details?**
Manpower details are required for companies utilising  Marine Shipyard or Process manpower quota as defined under MOM. These details are required to ensure that your workers’ SGWorkPass app AccessCode reflects their approval to be deployed for work and to facilitate arrangement for regular swab tests.

#### **12. I have successfully submitted my manpower details but the Workpass app still comes out as red. Can I proceed to deploy my workers?**
The AccessCode factors in a few parameters, namely:
- Worker’s health status 
- Worker’s place of residence is COVID-free
- Worker’s approval to work
- Download and activate latest version of TraceTogether

Only workers with a “green” AccessCode should be deployed to work on-site.
