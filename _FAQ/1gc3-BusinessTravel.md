## **<ins>Business Travel Pass</ins>**

#### **1. What is the pilot business travel pass about?**
- One of Singapore’s key value propositions is our position as an air and business hub. This includes the ease with which executives based in Singapore can travel around the region for work, to oversee regional operations.

- Unfortunately, the ease of travel has been severely affected by restrictions to safeguard against COVID-19. SME owners cannot visit their customers and factories in the region, and MNCs with global/regional HQ functions here are unable to operate fully. We need to enable these businessmen to travel more easily, and safely, or risk losing these business functions to other countries.

- Hence we are piloting a new business travel pass for senior executives in Singapore with regional or international roles who need to travel regularly for business. We are doing this in a gradual and calibrated manner to manage our public health situation carefully.

- Travellers on this pass will be required to abide by a strict controlled itinerary when they travel overseas for work.

o	Upon return, the traveller will undergo a PCR test (in lieu of SHN). 

o	He or she will also be required to self-isolate until the PCR test results are out and will have to abide by stringent health protocols in Singapore.

- Because public health remains our utmost priority, we will limit the number of such passes and carefully monitor the public health outcomes during the initial phase.

o	As we are piloting the scheme, the pass is not open for application at this point in time.

#### **2. What are the eligibility criteria for this travel pass? How are individuals selected for the pilot?**
- We are working with our economic agencies to identify a list of senior executives in Singapore with international or regional responsibilities who travel regularly for official and business purposes, and are progressively issuing the passes.

o	Approval is given only if we are satisfied that the individual will comply with the stringent public health requirements and safeguards.

o	We will also revoke the travel pass at any time if we find that the traveller failed to abide by the stringent health protocols.

#### **3. Why are travellers identified via economic agencies only, instead of through an open application?**
- Pre-identifying travellers through the economic agencies will allow us to monitor these travellers closely to determine the public health outcome of the scheme.

- Through the economic agencies, we will also be able to contact these travellers quickly in the event that we need to adjust parameters of the travel pass in response to a sudden change in the global epidemiological situation. The travellers will have to immediately adapt to and abide by any change in public health requirements.

- This is critical as public health remains our number one priority as we explore new ways to resume business travel to aid in our economic recovery.

#### **4. Why are we allowing travellers to come into Singapore without serving SHN?**
- Travellers on the pilot will be screened beforehand and have to take a pre-departure PCR test.

o	They are also required to comply with stringent public health requirements and additional safeguards. For instance, they are required to submit a controlled itinerary before leaving Singapore and adhere strictly to this itinerary abroad. 

- This pilot strikes a balance between managing public health risk and facilitating essential travel to aid Singapore’s economic recovery.

- Today, travellers can already take a pre-departure PCR test in lieu of SHN under the Singapore-China “Fast Lane”, and when coming to Singapore from Brunei and New Zealand.

- In order to limit the potential public health risk, we are starting only with a small number of travel passes during the pilot phase. 

#### **5. What are the health protocols and safeguards for this travel pass?**
- Travellers on the pilot will be required to submit a controlled itinerary of their meetings and activities while abroad, including the contacts they meet and venues they go to, and must adhere strictly to this controlled itinerary. 

- Before returning to Singapore, they are required to make a health declaration to ensure that they do not have symptoms and have not encountered anyone infected with COVID-19.

- Upon arriving in Singapore, they will take a PCR test at their own cost on arrival and are required to self-isolate for 2-3 days until they get a negative test result. 

- On top of that, they are required to use TraceTogether, avoid all forms of public transport within 14 days of return, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents.

- If they are found to have not abided by any of the conditions above, we will revoke the travel pass and remove them from the pilot.

#### **6. When will we find out if the pilot is successful? Do you know when will the travel pass be open for public application?**
- We do not have a fixed timeline for this pilot scheme. Our number one priority for now is public health and we want to carefully monitor the progress of this pilot before making any decisions.

#### **7. How many passes will be issued?**
- Because public health remains our priority, we will limit the number of business travel passes at the beginning and carefully monitor the public health outcomes during the initial phase.

#### **8. When will this pilot start?**
- The pilot initiative is ongoing. We have started issuing the business travel passes and are doing so in groups to ensure that the risks are carefully managed.

#### **9. Where can the senior executives travel to with the business travel pass?**
- The business travel pass is not country specific and senior executives will be able to travel to a range of countries. 

- Regardless of their destinations, the travellers must abide by both the destination’s public health rules, as well as the stringent health protocols in Singapore upon their return. 

- If they are found not to have abided by any of the protocols, we will revoke the travel pass and remove them from the pilot.
