#### **1. Can cinema patrons sit together?**
Groups of up to 5 persons (friends and family) are allowed to book tickets to sit together. Cinemas must ensure there is a 1 metre distance between different groups. 

#### **2. Are patrons supposed to put on masks at all times during the movie? Can they eat during the movie?**
Patrons are required to have masks on at all times except when they are consuming food and beverages inside the cinema hall. After eating/drinking, patrons should put masks back on. Cinema patrons are strongly encouraged to pre-order food and beverages online and collect the purchase on-site. 

#### **3. If the cinema is located in a shopping mall/building which has conducted temperature checks at its entrance, does this need to be repeated at the cinema entrance?**
This is not required. However, patrons must check-in using SafeEntry at the cinema entrance. 

#### **4. Are cinemas in shopping malls subject to the stipulated occupancy limit of malls?**
All malls are to comply with the occupancy limit of one person per 10sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA). While cinemas are not subject to such a limit, operators may wish to remind patrons to enter the mall early so as to avoid having to wait to enter the mall. There is no separate or special entry into the mall for cinema patrons – they must join the queue like every other mall visitor. 

#### **5. What are the hygiene practices the cinemas are undertaking as part of the reopening?**
Cinemas will cater additional time for cleaning of halls after every screening. There will be increased cleaning and disinfection of high touch point areas e.g. service counters, toilets, ticketing machines etc. 

#### **6. Can cinema patrons buy tickets on-site? Can cinemas start advance tickets sales via their websites prior to the official reopening on 13 July 2020?**
Cinema patrons may buy tickets on-site. However, they are strongly encouraged to book their tickets online and in advance, to avoid queues at the cinemas. For on-site purchases, cashless or contactless payments are strongly encouraged. Cinemas are advised to start advance ticket sales via their websites prior to the official reopening on 13 July 2020 to help ease crowds.

#### **7. Are reopening promotions allowed?**

In general, most events are not allowed in Phase 2.

For permitted enterprises that wish to organise other types of events, these would be subject to the <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S254-2020?DocDate=20200407" target="_blank">COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations</a>, in particular Regulations 10 and 13.

For private events, individuals holding private gatherings e.g. birthday parties will have to comply with the restrictions in <a href="https://sso.agc.gov.sg/SL/COVID19TMA2020-S254-2020?DocDate=20200407&ProvIds=pr6-#pr6-" target="_blank">Regulation 6 of the Control Order</a>. The 5 pax limit for social gatherings would generally apply with exceptions as stated in Regulation 6.
