#### **1. I am not a permitted service firm and have a shipment of goods coming in. Will I be allowed to send the goods to my warehouse and will I be able to activate my employees to receive the shipment at my warehouse?**
Port operators and logistics service providers will be allowed to continue to operate during this period. Yes, you may receive deliveries at your premises. If you need to activate your employees to work on-site for short periods of time to receive deliveries and perform other related tasks, please apply for a time-limited exemption. Please submit your application **one day before** the required date of use.

#### **2. If the factory is closed, but some of the components are being shipped in, can the company still maintain a minimum number of employees onsite to clear the goods?**
Yes, the intention is to keep goods flowing in and to keep the port clear.
