## **<ins>General Safe Management Measures</ins>**

#### **1. How many persons can I have at my solemnization ceremony?**
You may have up to 10 persons for solemnizations in homes, in ROM(M) Building, or at designated area(s) in the National Museum of Singapore, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

In other external solemnization venues, such as places of worship or hotels, you may have up to 50 attendees at your solemnization ceremony, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. This attendance limit excludes the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization. Please check with your solemnization venue owner / operator on the number of attendees allowed and any other conditions to be met before making arrangements. 

#### **2. Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers, make-up artists, bridal studio) allowed to resume operations for solemnizations? Are they part of the guest limit?**
Vendors engaged should be on MTI’s permitted list of activities as reflected on the GoBusiness portal and should have made their manpower declarations to MTI within two weeks of resuming operations. Vendors who are allowed to resume operations for your solemnization can be excluded from the guest limit for your solemnization / reception but should be kept to a minimum.

#### **3. Does the guest limit for in-person solemnizations include the interpreter?**
No, the guest limit excludes the interpreter, Licensed Solemnizer, and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

#### **4. Do we need to practise safe distancing and safe management during the solemnization?**
Yes, safe management measures must be in place for the solemnizations. 

For solemnizations held at home, the ROM Building and designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore, up to 10 persons can attend, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization.

For solemnizations held at other venues, couples can have up to 50 persons, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, the interpreter (if any), and vendors (kept to a minimum) allowed to resume operations for your solemnization. If couples have more than 20 guests, attendees should be split into a designated core “wedding party” comprising up to 20 persons (including the bride and groom, and the 2 witnesses), and groups of up to five people for the remaining guests. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1 metre distance from the smaller groups of five. The groups of five should not intermingle or mix, and should also maintain 1 metre distance from each other. 

All attendees should also check their temperature and that they are feeling well before they attend your solemnization. For contact tracing purposes, the wedding couple should inform your Licensed Solemnizer of the names of the attendees, and keep the attendance record for 14 days after your solemnization. For solemnizations in external venues (i.e. besides home and ROM/M), all guests should also check in and out via SafeEntry, and download and activate the TraceTogether app before attending the solemnization.

#### **5. Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?**
The bride and groom may use face masks or face shields throughout the solemnization process. In addition, they may remove their masks and/or face shields for key moments of the solemnization, which includes the exchanging of vows, rings, and to kiss and during march-ins/outs. However, the bride and groom should maintain a 2-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the solemnization whenever masks and face shields have been removed. All other attendees should have their masks on throughout the solemnization process[^1]. 

Masks / face shields may be removed briefly for photo-taking, but should be put on immediately after photos.

#### **6. Can other accompanying parties remove their face masks during the march-in/out?**
No. Only the bride and groom may remove their masks and/or face shields during march-ins/outs. All other attendees should have their masks on throughout the solemnization process.

#### **7. How long can our solemnization ceremony last?**
For the safety of the bride, groom, and guests, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

#### **8. Will these measures, including the limit on the number of people, change in the future?**
These guidelines are based on the current situation, and take effect from 4 Aug 2020. The guidelines may change, depending on the COVID-19 situation at that point in time.

You may wish to refer here for updates on the COVID-19 situation in Singapore.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in homes</ins>**

#### **9. Can we hold our solemnization at home? What are the safe management measures that we must follow?**
Yes, you may hold your solemnization at home, involving up to 10 persons, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter, and any other vendors (kept to a minimum). These 10 persons may include guests who are not immediate family members. 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	All guests should wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and to kiss and during march-ins/outs. Other guests should maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. The bride, groom, and guests may remove their masks briefly for photo-taking. 
- b.	Maintain a safe distance from those from a different household.
- c.	You must also declare to your Licensed Solemnizer the guest list at least 1 day before the solemnization. 

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All attendees should check their temperature and ensure they are feeling well before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  
 
The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures[^2].

#### **10. Can I have a small wedding reception at home immediately after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites in the home before or after the solemnization?**
Receptions are not allowed in your home. Couples may want to consider having a separate reception (see Q.19) at allowed venues where proper safe management measures can be observed more readily. Any other pre- or post-solemnization activities held at home should abide by the prevailing number of visitors allowed for home visits.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in the ROM(M) Building and other locations ROM is operating out of</ins>**

#### **11. What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnization in the ROM(M) Building and the designated area(s) at the National Museum of Singapore?**
Up to 10 persons may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter (if any), and any other vendors (which should be kept to a minimum). These 10 persons may include guests who are not immediate family members. 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	All guests should wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and to kiss and during march-ins/outs. Other guests should maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. Masks may be removed briefly for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after.
- b.	You will be required to check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises. 
- c.	You will also need to declare your guests and vendors to ROM during your Verification of Documents and Statutory Declaration appointment.

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  
 
The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. 

#### **12. Can I have a small wedding reception at ROM(M) Building after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization at ROM(M) Building?**
No, receptions and other activities outside of the solemnization are not permitted in the ROM(M) Building or designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore operated by ROM.

#### **13. Can I have more than 10 people for my home solemnization, if my house is sufficiently large to accommodate everybody safely?**
We recognise that your solemnization is an important event for you and your family. However, we are also mindful that due to the intimate nature of solemnizations in the home context, there will likely be high level of chances of interaction. Unlike external venues, there will also be no premise staff to support you in implementing the safe management measures. All these pose greater risks to you, your family, and guests, especially any vulnerable groups who may be present. Hence, the cap for home solemnizations remains at 10 persons.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in Places of Worship</ins>**

#### **14. Can we hold our solemnization at Places of Worship? What are the safe management measures that we must follow?**
Up to 50 persons (subject to the safe capacity of the venue) may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, religious and supporting workers, and vendors (which should be kept to a minimum). 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	For solemnizations with more than 20 attendees, attendees should be split into a group of 20 (called the “wedding party”), and groups of 5. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1-metre distance from the smaller groups of 5. The groups of 5 should also maintain a 1-metre distance from each other. 
- b.	All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and to kiss and during march-ins/outs, as long as they maintain a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others.
- c.	Masks/ face shields may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after.
- d.	All attendees should take their temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app for the duration of the solemnization.  
- e.	You must also declare to your Solemnizer your guest and vendor list at least 1 day before the solemnization. 

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. Any guest who is not feeling well should not attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  
 
The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. 

#### **15. Can the solemnization be accompanied by a religious service or rite?**
Yes, your solemnization may be accompanied by a religious service or rite. However, for the safety of yourself and your attendees, this should be kept as short as possible. You may contact your Religious Organisation or MCCY’s Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations Programme Office at <a href = "mailto: cpro@mccy.gov.sg">cpro@mccy.gov.sg</a> if you have further queries.

#### **16. Can I have a small wedding reception at the Place of Worship after my solemnization? Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization?**
There may not be any reception with food and drinks, or wedding celebrations that are not essential religious rites conducted at places of worship. You may contact your Religious Organisation or MCCY’s Crisis Preparedness for Religious Organisations Programme Office at <a href = "mailto: cpro@mccy.gov.sg">cpro@mccy.gov.sg</a> if you have further queries.

## **<ins>Solemnizations in other external venues</ins>**

#### **17. Can I have my solemnization at a hotel / F&B restaurant / condominium clubhouse / country club (other private venues) etc?**
You may have your solemnization at any venue opened for operation. You may check directly with the venue operator on whether the venue is available for use for your solemnization.

#### **18. What are the safe management measures that we must follow for solemnizations outside of the home / the ROM(M) Building?**
Up to 50 persons, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower, may attend the solemnization, excluding the Licensed Solemnizer, interpreter, and any other vendors (kept to a minimum). 

For the safety of all who are attending your solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	For solemnizations with more than 20 persons (up to a max of 50), attendees should be split into a group of 20 (called the “wedding party”), and groups of 5. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1-metre distance from the smaller groups of 5. The groups of 5 should also maintain 1-metre distance from each other, and there should be no intermingling between groups. 
- b.	All guests should wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. The bride and groom may choose to wear face shields instead for the duration of the solemnization, and may remove their face shields for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, and to kiss and during march-ins/outs. Other guests should maintain 2 metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked.
- c.	Masks may be removed briefly for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after 
- d.	Guests will be required to take their temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app for the duration of the solemnization.  
- e.	You must also declare to your Solemnizer your guest and vendor list at least 1 day before the solemnization. 
- f.	Premises hosting multiple events or that are accessible by non-wedding patrons and members of the public are to put in place measures to ensure no inter-mixing between events, or between wedding guests and other patrons (e.g. physical barrier, separate rooms).

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the solemnization. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).
 
The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. 

#### **19. Can I have a pre- / post- solemnization reception or provide food / buffet as part of our ceremony?**
Food and beverages are not allowed to be served as part of the solemnization ceremony. Couples may hold one reception either on the same day as the solemnization or on a separate day.

#### **20. What happens if the solemnization is back to back with the F&B reception i.e. solemnization followed by F&B reception in the same room?**
If the solemnization is back-to-back with the F&B reception, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to an overall cap of 50 persons, and no other receptions would be allowed.

#### **21. Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony before or after the solemnization?**
Cultural rites involving food and beverages are not allowed to be conducted as part of the solemnization ceremony. The performance of cultural rites before or after the solemnization should take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

Such cultural rites may take place as part of the wedding reception if they do not involve live performances or other prohibited activities for wedding receptions. For example, the tea ceremony can be held amongst the “wedding party” of 20 persons as part of the reception, and should take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

## **<ins>Other wedding activities</ins>**

#### **22. Can I hold a reception? How many receptions can I hold? What are the guidelines for receptions?**
You can have only one reception, held on the same day as the solemnization or on a separate day[^3]. If the reception takes place in the same location right after the solemnization, the entire event (solemnization and reception) is subject to the overall cap of 50 persons (or lower based on the venue). You may hold your reception in controlled premises opened for operation (outside of the home, the ROM(M) Building and designated areas in the National Museum of Singapore operated by ROM) that can accommodate receptions whereby safe management measures are implemented and enforced. You may check directly with the venue operator on their processes and conditions for the holding of the reception. Venue owners/ operators may determine if and when to allow solemnizations and receptions to be held in their premises, and may set additional conditions for their use, such as setting a lower limit for attendance based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

For such receptions, you may have up to 50 persons, or the safe capacity of the venue, whichever is lower. For the safety of all who are attending your reception, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

- a.	For solemnizations and receptions with more than 20 attendees, attendees should be split into a group of 20 (called the “wedding party”), and groups of 5. The “wedding party” should maintain a 1-metre distance from the smaller groups of 5. The groups of 5 should also maintain 1 metre distance from each other. There should be no intermingling or mixing between groups.
- b.	There should be fixed seating for all attendees. Pre-wedding receptions, freestanding activities and interactions such as drinks receptions are not permitted. 
- c.	Self-service buffets are not allowed. Sharing dishes/ platters is strongly discouraged. 
- d.	Sale and consumption of alcohol is prohibited after 2230hrs.
- e.	Interactions (e.g. face-to-face greetings or conversations) between the “wedding party” and all other guests should be kept to a minimum. 
- f.	Live performances or activities involving singing or shouting are not permitted. Event emcees and persons making speeches on stage may wear face shields in lieu of face masks when speaking on stage, if they are standing in a fixed position and maintaining at least 1m distance from all other persons, in line with MOH’s guidelines for the use of face masks and shields issued on 1 Jun 2020.
- g.	Guests will be required to take your temperature, check in and out via SafeEntry before entering the premises, and download and activate the TraceTogether app before attending the event.
- h.	Attendees’ arrival and departure timings should be staggered, and queueing in groups should be discouraged.

We must remain vigilant to protect ourselves and our loved ones. All guests should check their temperature and ensure they are not feeling unwell before they attend the reception. You may wish to encourage your guests, especially if they are more vulnerable, to refrain from attending your solemnization in person. Instead, they can join in the celebrations safely by using technology (e.g. witness the solemnization through a video link).  
 
The organiser is liable for ensuring that all attendees observe the necessary safe management measures. Please refer <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/" target="_blank">here</a> for the full set of safe management measures. If your venue operator has further questions regarding receptions, they can contact the relevant agency overseeing their operations (e.g. Enterprise Singapore for F&B establishments[^4], Singapore Tourism Board for hotels).

#### **23. Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony during the reception?**
Yes you may, subject to the safe management guidelines for receptions (e.g. no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests).

#### **24. Can we have our tea ceremony at the external solemnization venue?**
Yes you may, but this will be regarded as separate from the solemnization ceremony, as activities involving food and beverages are not allowed to be conducted as part of the solemnization ceremony. The tea ceremony before or after the solemnization will be subject to the prevailing safe management guidelines for general gatherings (e.g. no more than 5 visitors in a home). Nonetheless, the tea ceremony can be held as part of a wedding reception, amongst the “wedding party” of 20 persons, and should take into account the prevailing national guidelines for that activity.

#### **25. Can we do our pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from our solemnization?**
You may do your pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from your solemnization. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the Safe Management Measures that must be adhered to.

#### **26. Can we hire a photographer to take photos of my wedding dinner/reception, and can the photographer take photos of guests at each table by adhering to the 1 metre distancing?**
Yes, you can hire a photographer to take photos of the wedding reception. A 1-metre distance between the photographer and the subject(s) of photography should be maintained at all times. However, there should be no intermingling between the wedding party and guests (i.e. table-to-table photos should be avoided). Masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and should be put on immediately after.

#### **27. Can the bride and groom stand/ sit on the stage and take photos with the wedding party of 20? Can masks be removed momentarily for this?**
Yes, they can mingle and take photos with one another within the core party of 20 persons (including the bride and groom). Other guests not in the core party of 20 should not be interacting with the bride and groom (or persons from any other groups), and therefore should not be taking photos together.

#### **28. Can we play video screenings and/or projections of our wedding photos during the reception?**
Yes, you can. However, there should be no live singing, cheering, loud toasting or shouting during the reception.

#### **29. Can weddings that are up to 20 pax be considered a wedding party where the hosts and guests are allowed to interact as a group?**
Yes, if the limit is kept at 20 pax throughout the entire reception.

#### **30. If I have a wedding reception of up to 50 persons now, can I have another reception should the limits be increased subsequently?**
The conditions for the holding of marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions during the COVID-19 situation will depend on the prevailing circumstances and policies. Based on the current limit of one reception per couple, a second reception is not allowed.

#### **31. Must the 50 people in the solemnization and reception be the same?**
No, they need not be the same 50 people. However, you are encouraged to keep your number of social contacts to a minimum to reduce the risk of large clusters forming.

#### **32. Can a wedding couple hold one wedding reception for more than 50 people, as long as only 50 people attend per designated time slot?**
No. Each wedding couple can have only one reception, where the total number of attendees has to be capped at 50 persons throughout the entire event (i.e. only 50 attendees in total), or a lower number subject to the size of the premise and safe management requirements. This excludes vendors and premise staff (kept to a minimum).

#### **33. If there are certain guests that attend the reception purely to meet and greet the couple and leave straightaway without sitting in to eat and drink, would they be counted as part of the 50 people attendees limit?**
The total number of attendees has to be capped at 50 persons throughout the entire event (i.e. only 50 attendees in total), or a lower number subject to the size of the premise and safe management requirements. This includes those who attend the reception for a short duration without eating or drinking.

#### **34. Are there any duration limits or time restrictions for wedding reception/solemnization?**
There is no fixed time frame/ duration limit, but it is recommended to keep the sessions as brief as possible. The total number of attendees has to be capped at 50 persons throughout the entire event (i.e. only 50 attendees in total) or a lower number subject to the size of the premise and safe management requirements. Note that only up to 10 persons are allowed for solemnization in homes, in ROM(M) building, or at designated area(s) in the National Museum of Singapore, excluding the licensed solemnizer, and vendors (kept to a minimum). In other external solemnization venues, such as places of worship or hotels, the cap is up to 50 persons, or the safe capacity of the venue whichever is lower, excluding licensed solemnizer, and vendors (kept to a minimum). Alcohol cannot be served or consumed after 10.30pm.

#### **35. Does the set up of the ceremony allow for a stage, reception table etc?**
A stage can be set up as part of the ceremony, but there should be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests, or between groups of guests. A reception table is allowed, if it is to receive guests when they arrive. However, any interactions should be minimized. E-check-in or other contactless methods of registration should be adopted where possible.

#### **36. Is a food line able to be set-up with safe distancing queues and served by the servers at hand?**
Guests are to be served seated at their tables, instead of queuing at the food lines. This is to minimise unnecessary mingling/ crowding, and to reduce interaction amongst different groups of guests. Organisers can offer individually plated or packaged food, and should avoid shared platters or dishes. For solemnizations, food and beverages are strictly not allowed.

#### **37. What is the rationale that the reception should be held no more than twelve months after the registration of marriage?**
The easing of restrictions on two key life events (weddings and funerals) is part of a careful, calibrated, resumption of activities in Phase 2. While recognising the need for the importance of these key life events to continue, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce will also need to assess the ability of the organisers and venue owners to ensure that the necessary safe management measures are put in place and adhered to, given the higher risk of community transmission at such events. While calibrating the number of wedding receptions held in the first place, we had also considered that most receptions take place within the 12-months period following the solemnization. We will continue to review the parameters for such events.

## **<ins>Video-link solemnizations</ins>**

#### **38. If we opt for solemnization via video link, can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue? Is there a limit to the number of guests in the same venue?**
The bride, groom, and witnesses can be in the same location if they belong to the same household. If the solemnization is held in the home, then in line with the safe distancing measures, you should not have more than 5 visitors in your home. Other guests may wish to join in through the video link instead. Such processes through video links are to enable marriage solemnizations to take place in a safe manner.
