These proposals must include safe management measures that are tailored to reduce the COVID-19 transmission risks at each attraction or tour. 

Hotels may apply to STB to reopen recreation areas for children (e.g. Kids' Club) and provide accommodation to guests for the purposes of leisure (e.g. staycations). Hotels may submit their application to STB for assessment and may only resume these business activities and related marketing efforts after receiving approval from MTI. Hotels that wish to resume these activities must comply with the required safe management measures.
