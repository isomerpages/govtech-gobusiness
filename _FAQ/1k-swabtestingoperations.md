## **<ins>Background Information</ins>**

#### **1. Why is MOH conducting testing operations for food delivery personnel?**
To facilitate the progressive reopening of social and economic activities, MOH will be offering testing to identified community groups such as food delivery personnel.  

There is currently no evidence that this group is of a higher risk prevalence. MOH will be offering complimentary tests to them given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of the public. We strongly encourage all food delivery personnel to come forward for testing to provide assurance to their loved ones and those around them. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.

#### **2. What other groups will be tested?**
As a start, MOH will be conducting testing operations for Point-to-Point (P2P) drivers, food delivery personnel, vendors servicing dormitories, as well as hawkers and wet market vendors. MOH will progressively review and expand complimentary testing to other identified groups.

#### **3. Why is SafeEntry being expanded to more places?**
As more activities and services gradually resume following the circuit breaker period, it is important that efforts to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters can be done quickly to limit the risk of further community transmission.  SafeEntry helps support and quicken these efforts to prevent and control the incidence or transmission of COVID-19 as it provides authorities with a record of individuals who enter and exit places. The records will reduce the time needed to identify potential close contacts of COVID-19 patients and potential COVID-19 clusters. This is important so that we can continue advancing towards fewer restrictions on our movements, and our daily lives.

#### **4. SafeEntry is already implemented for my building (e.g. Mall), do tenants within the building have to implement SafeEntry as well?**
As part of safe workplace measures, all businesses and services that are in operation must institute SafeEntry for their employees, associates and vendors. Further, places listed on <a target="_blank" href="https://go.gov.sg/safeentrydeloyment">https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/deployment</a> such as supermarkets and hairdressing salons will have to implement SafeEntry for customers, clients and visitors, even if they are within a building e.g. mall.

#### **5. As a SafeEntry enabled business / venue operator, am I required to use SafeEntry for emergency service providers (e.g. SCDF ambulance staff or firefighters) entering the premise during an emergency?**
No. In emergency situations, priority should be placed on addressing the situation. The authorities will use other data available to help in contact tracing efforts should the need arises.

#### **6. I am required under 10B of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 to “as far as is reasonably practicable, obtain and keep the contact particulars of every individual” before allowing him or her to enter my premises, so as to facilitate contact tracing measures. Can I fulfil this by deploying SafeEntry?**
Yes. The deployment of SafeEntry will facilitate the Government’s contact tracing measures, and will fulfil the above requirement under Regulation 10B.

#### **7. Why do we need to use SafeEntry instead of existing vendor management systems?**
The use of SafeEntry is mandatory because a common system used by all establishments would allow data to be made available to MOH quickly, so as to facilitate efforts to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 through activities such as contact tracing and identification of COVID-19 clusters. SafeEntry allows information of visitors and employees who may have come into contact with COVID-19 cases to be sent to the authorities automatically. Contact data collected by SafeEntry is only used by authorised personnel, and stringent measures are in place to safeguard the data in accordance with the Government’s data security standards.

#### **8. I am already using an existing visitor management system. Is it possible to integrate this with SafeEntry?**
SafeEntry is not able to support integrations with other systems at the moment.

#### **9. Do businesses and venues have to enforce both check in and check out?**
Only check-in for SafeEntry needs to be enforced. This applies to workplaces too.

Businesses and venues should facilitate check-out on a best-effort principle. This includes prominently displaying QR codes at exit points and reminding staff and visitors to check out wherever possible. 

#### **10. Can visitors check in using one mode and exist using another mode (e.g. QR and NRIC)?**
Yes, they can.

#### **11. What happens if SafeEntry breaks down? Is there flexibility in the enforcement of SafeEntry?**
Businesses should tap on the alternate mode of SafeEntry in the unlikely event that their preferred mode breaks down, i.e. use SafeEntry QR as back-up if SafeEntry NRIC is the preferred mode, and vice versa. Businesses may do so by setting up the alternate mode at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.SafeEntry.gov.sg">https://www.SafeEntry.gov.sg</a>. SafeEntry does not recommend hard copy form filling as a back-up. 

The common use of SafeEntry by all establishments would allow data to be automatically sent to MOH. Hard copy recording of particulars would present a gap in this automated process and affect the contact tracing process. 

#### **12. Deployment of SafeEntry can result in significant congestion during certain periods. Can businesses and venues temporarily stand down SafeEntry during these periods?**
It is important to capture information for SafeEntry especially during high footfall periods. Businesses and venues should develop plans so that they are able to implement SafeEntry at all times.  Businesses should have a system to manage potential crowds, for instance, putting up more QR codes so that people can pre-fill their information before reaching the entrance. 

#### **13. With the implementation of SafeEntry, are the health and other relevant declarations still required?**
Yes, they are  still required to ensure the safety of individuals within venues. Declarations by individuals via SafeEntry with QR can be used to fulfil the requirements for the various declarations. Premises that use SafeEntry with NRIC must display prominent signs informing all visitors and employees that they are making the relevant declarations by checking in via SafeEntry.

#### **14. If I don’t have an NRIC or smartphone, will I be denied entry? What is the alternative should both options be unavailable to a member of public?**
Individuals visiting venues are required to provide the necessary information  via SafeEntry. Individuals may be denied entry if they do not provide the necessary information.

SafeEntry does not recommend hard copy filing as a back-up. The common use of SafeEntry by all establishments would allow data to be automatically sent to MOH. Hard copy recording of particulars would present a gap in this automated process and affect the contact tracing process. 

To cater to visitors who do not have a suitable mobile phone to scan QR codes, or do not have their identification cards with them, venue operators should assist the individual to check in  through the manual entry function in SafeEntry with NRIC or the webform in SafeEntry with QR using any available device. 

#### **15. Are there data safeguards in place when using SafeEntry?**
The data collected via SafeEntry is encrypted and stored in the Government server, which will only be accessed by the authorities when needed for the purpose of preventing or controlling the transmission of COVID-19.  The Government is the custodian of the data submitted by individuals, and there will be stringent security measures in place to safeguard  the personal data. Only authorised public officers will have access to the data. Under the Public Sector Governance Act, public officers who recklessly or intentionally disclose the data without authorisation, misuse the data for a gain, or re-identify anonymised data may be found guilty of an offence and may be subject to a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment of up to 2 years, or both.  The data will be purged when it is no longer needed for such  purposes.

#### **16. How will the Government check and ensure that businesses are using SafeEntry? What are the penalties for individuals who flout the rules?**
Businesses are required to use SafeEntry to collect entry information of workers and visitors on their premises for as long as it is required by law during the period of COVID-19.

Businesses that do not comply with the requirement to use SafeEntry will be subject to the relevant penalties, including those stipulated under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act.

#### **17. Where can I find more information about SafeEntry?**
More technical details on SafeEntry can be found at <a href="https://www.safeentry.gov.sg/" target="_blank">SafeEntry</a>.

#### **18. Must all street-hail passengers scan the SafeEntry QR code?**
Passengers should be socially responsible and scan the SafeEntry QR codes at the point of boarding. If passengers are unwilling to do so, taxi drivers can decline to such passengers.

#### **19. What about Taxi Booking and Private Hire passengers? Do they also need to scan the SafeEntry QR code?**
No. Passengers who book their rides via taxi apps or ride hail platforms need not do the same as there is already other data available to help in contact tracing efforts when the need arises. 

#### **20. What is TraceTogether? How does it work?**
TraceTogether is a mobile application that is designed to supplement current contact tracing efforts. It works by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between phones to detect other participating TraceTogether users in close proximity. 

Records of such encounters are stored locally on each user’s phone. If a user is interviewed by MOH as part of the contact tracing efforts, he/she can consent to send his/her TraceTogether data to MOH.

The TraceTogether app is available for download on App Store and Google Play Store. For more details and queries specific to how foreign workers and their employers can use TraceTogether, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg">https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg</a> or MOM’s website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/tracetogether#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20know%20if,FCDs%20%2C%20CTQs%20or%20TOL%20quarters.">here</a>.

#### **21. I am carrying a TraceTogether Token. Am I still required to check in with SafeEntry?**
All individuals with TraceTogether Tokens are still required to check in with SafeEntry whenever they enter venues that have implemented SafeEntry. Digital tools such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether enable speedier contact tracing and prevent the formation of new COVID-19 clusters. SafeEntry provides the authorities with a record of individuals who enter and exit venues while TraceTogether helps to identify close contacts.

#### **22. My worksite does not allow workers to hold on to mobile phones while at the work area due to safety/ security reasons. Can I use other methods to replace TraceTogether?**
Unless there are potential contraventions of prevailing MOM workplace health and safety regulations, it will be a requirement for all personnel entering site to have a smart phone with TraceTogether app installed before they are allowed to enter the site. All personnel have to ensure that the TraceTogether app is turned on (i.e. Bluetooth is switched on) and that they carry their handphone with them at all times within the worksite. In the application to resume/ reinstate works or increase manning, the Shipyard and their contractors have to confirm that this requirement can be achieved.

## **<ins>Group Check-in</ins>**

#### **23. What is the SafeEntry Group Check-in feature in the SingPass mobile app?**
The SafeEntry Group Check-in feature allows SingPass mobile users to check-in together with other individuals, primarily their family members, when entering a location.

With this feature, users may add their family members to a check-in list and select up to five members (including themselves) when checking in to a location together, which would help ease queues at the entrance of public spaces. Watch the how-to video here. 

Please take note that when you use the group check-in feature, you are making a declaration on behalf of your family members; and you will be held responsible for ensuring the accuracy of everyone’s check-in information within the group. If any family member wishes to leave the venue earlier, he / she should check in individually.

#### **24. Can I add an individual who is not my family member (e.g. friend or co-worker) into my check-in list?**
While this feature is primarily meant for family members, you may add any individual into your check-in list if:

- a.	All members are staying in the same place of residence; and/or 
- b.	All of you travel as a group to and from the location by the same mode of transport.

In the situation where you need to check-in with a friend or co-worker, e.g. if you are staying together as roommates, please ensure that you have their explicit permission and knowledge to add their NRIC/FIN to your check-in list. Please take note that when you use the group check-in feature, you are making a declaration on behalf of others.

#### **25. Can I add my domestic helper into the check-in list?**
You may add your domestic helper to your check-in list by entering his / her FIN number indicated on his / her work permit.

#### **26. What should I do when a family member, whom I have checked in together with, leaves the venue much earlier than I do?**
We advise users to plan ahead – if you are likely to check out separately, please check-in separately. In case of an unplanned situation, the user who has conducted the check-in will be responsible for ensuring accuracy in his/her family members’ movement. To support contact tracing efforts, the user should ensure that the check-out is only performed when the last person leaves the venue.
