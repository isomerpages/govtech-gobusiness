## **<ins>Background Information</ins>**

#### **1. Why is MOH conducting testing operations for food delivery personnel?**
To facilitate the progressive reopening of social and economic activities, MOH will be offering testing to identified community groups such as food delivery personnel.  

There is currently no evidence that this group is of a higher risk prevalence. MOH will be offering complimentary tests to them given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of the public. We strongly encourage all food delivery personnel to come forward for testing to provide assurance to their loved ones and those around them. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.

#### **2. What other groups will be tested?**
As a start, MOH will be conducting testing operations for Point-to-Point (P2P) drivers, food delivery personnel, vendors servicing dormitories, as well as hawkers and wet market vendors. MOH will progressively review and expand complimentary testing to other identified groups.

#### **3. How long will these testing operations be conducted for?**
The government is conducting the pilot testing operations at two temporary testing facilities at Marine Parade on 19 Sep 2020 (Sat) and 20 Sep 2020 (Sun). These testing facilities would be available for the testing of food delivery personnel, hawkers, coffeeshop operators, stallholders and stall assistants around the area.

#### **4. How frequently will these tests be conducted? Will similar operations be conducted in the future?**
The testing operations at Marine Parade will be a one-time exercise. There is no need for individuals to return for regular testing. MOH will review the results of the complimentary testing operations to assess the need for further testing of the sector.

More details on the full roll-out of the COVID-19 testing plans for the identified community groups will be made known when ready.

#### **5. Is the swab test compulsory?**
The swab test is not compulsory, but we strongly encourage food delivery personnel to be tested so that they can take measures to protect themselves and their loved ones if tested positive. They will also be able to receive prompt medical treatment if required.

#### **6. Are there any rewards/ incentives for food delivery personnel who come forward for testing?**
The government will bear the full costs of the swab tests. By stepping forward for testing, food delivery personnel can also provide assurance to their loved ones and those around them.

#### **7. Is the swab test painful?**
Depending on each individual’s threshold, some may experience some discomfort during the swab test. The swabbers are well-trained and experienced and will do their best to ensure a smooth and painless process as far as possible.

#### **8. Is there an age limit to taking the swab test?**
No, there is no age limit. Anyone above the age of 12 can undergo a swab test.

#### **9. For those who have previously tested negative/positive for COVID-19 and are already well now, do they still need to be tested?**
Food delivery personnel who have previously tested negative for COVID-19 are strongly encouraged to register for a swab test. 

Individuals who have tested positive from COVID-19 do not need to be retested for COVID-19 if it is still within 180 days from the onset of infection

## **<ins>Registration for Testing</ins>**

#### **10. How should food delivery personnel register for a swab appointment?**
For this pilot, pre-registration is mandatory due to the limited testing availability. Interested food delivery personnel can access FormSG here to register for a testing slot. Registration will open from 14 September 2020, 0700 hours to 16 September 2020, 1900 hours.

The confirmed appointment date and time will be communicated to them through email. They are also strongly encouraged to keep to their assigned appointment slot. 

#### **11. Is the pilot open to all food delivery personnel?**
For a start, this pilot community testing will be available to food delivery personnel of key food delivery platforms and food chains, who are some of the largest employers of food delivery personnel. These include Deliveroo, foodpanda, GrabFood and McDonald’s.

#### **12. If a food delivery personnel who registered for the test is unable to make it for the allocated slot for the test, can he/she reschedule his/her appointment?**
Food delivery personnel are strongly advised to keep to their assigned appointment slots. Those who miss their appointments slots can still go for the swab at the appointed site, during the period of the testing exercise (19 - 20 September 2020). However, this is subject to the availability of tests that day.

#### **13. What if a food delivery personnel who registered for the test is on Medical Leave? Would he/she need to go for the swab test?**
Individuals on medical leave are encouraged to stay at home to rest. Individuals who display fever or upper respiratory tract related symptoms (cough, runny nose, sore throat, etc.) should see a doctor immediately.

#### **14. Can food delivery personnel still take the swab test if they did not pre-register for it?**
Due to limited testing capacity, pre-registration for the swab test is mandatory for this pilot; walk-ins are not allowed. There is a limit of 100 food delivery personnel each day at each location. 

The full roll-out of the COVID-19 testing plans for food delivery personnel will be made known when ready. Those who are unable to participate in this pilot, can look out for the details when available and opt to go for swab tests at other locations at a later date.

#### **15. What if the food delivery personnel has just returned from Home Quarantine Order, Stay- Home Notice or 5-day Medical Leave? Would they need to go for the swab test?**
Individuals returning from Home Quarantine Order (HQO), Stay Home Notice (SHN) or 5-day Medical Leave can take the swab test only if their HQO, SHN or 5-day Medical Leave has ended by the date of the scheduled swab appointment. Individuals currently serving their HQO/SHN must remain isolated at their place of residence.

#### **16. For food delivery personnel who are not available during the testing period or are unable to participate in this pilot, can they still get swabbed?**
The pilot testing exercise will only be conducted on 19 Sep 2020 (Sat) and 20 Sep 2020 (Sun). 

The full roll-out of the COVID-19 testing plans for food delivery personnel will be made known when ready. Those who are unable to participate in this pilot, can look out for the details when available and opt to go for swab tests at other locations at a later date.   

## **<ins>On the day of the swab test</ins>**

#### **17. What identification will food delivery personnel need to bring along for their swab test?**
They are required to produce proof of identity as a food delivery personnel (e.g. through delivery apps, staff pass) and a form of photo identification with their NRIC number (e.g. NRIC, Vocational Licence, Driver’s Licence).

#### **18. How long will the entire swabbing process take?**
The swab process typically ranges between 10 and 15 mins. Food delivery personnel are required to register for an appointment and should keep to their allocated appointment slot where possible. We seek the understanding of registrants that there might be a waiting time before their turn for the swabbing process.

#### **19. What about Taxi Booking and Private Hire passengers? Do they also need to scan the SafeEntry QR code?**
No. Passengers who book their rides via taxi apps or ride hail platforms need not do the same as there is already other data available to help in contact tracing efforts when the need arises. 

#### **20. What is TraceTogether? How does it work?**
TraceTogether is a mobile application that is designed to supplement current contact tracing efforts. It works by exchanging short-distance Bluetooth signals between phones to detect other participating TraceTogether users in close proximity. 

Records of such encounters are stored locally on each user’s phone. If a user is interviewed by MOH as part of the contact tracing efforts, he/she can consent to send his/her TraceTogether data to MOH.

The TraceTogether app is available for download on App Store and Google Play Store. For more details and queries specific to how foreign workers and their employers can use TraceTogether, visit <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg">https://www.tracetogether.gov.sg</a> or MOM’s website <a target="_blank" href="https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/frequently-asked-questions/tracetogether#:~:text=How%20do%20I%20know%20if,FCDs%20%2C%20CTQs%20or%20TOL%20quarters.">here</a>.

#### **21. I am carrying a TraceTogether Token. Am I still required to check in with SafeEntry?**
All individuals with TraceTogether Tokens are still required to check in with SafeEntry whenever they enter venues that have implemented SafeEntry. Digital tools such as SafeEntry and TraceTogether enable speedier contact tracing and prevent the formation of new COVID-19 clusters. SafeEntry provides the authorities with a record of individuals who enter and exit venues while TraceTogether helps to identify close contacts.

#### **22. My worksite does not allow workers to hold on to mobile phones while at the work area due to safety/ security reasons. Can I use other methods to replace TraceTogether?**
Unless there are potential contraventions of prevailing MOM workplace health and safety regulations, it will be a requirement for all personnel entering site to have a smart phone with TraceTogether app installed before they are allowed to enter the site. All personnel have to ensure that the TraceTogether app is turned on (i.e. Bluetooth is switched on) and that they carry their handphone with them at all times within the worksite. In the application to resume/ reinstate works or increase manning, the Shipyard and their contractors have to confirm that this requirement can be achieved.

## **<ins>Group Check-in</ins>**

#### **23. What is the SafeEntry Group Check-in feature in the SingPass mobile app?**
The SafeEntry Group Check-in feature allows SingPass mobile users to check-in together with other individuals, primarily their family members, when entering a location.

With this feature, users may add their family members to a check-in list and select up to five members (including themselves) when checking in to a location together, which would help ease queues at the entrance of public spaces. Watch the how-to video here. 

Please take note that when you use the group check-in feature, you are making a declaration on behalf of your family members; and you will be held responsible for ensuring the accuracy of everyone’s check-in information within the group. If any family member wishes to leave the venue earlier, he / she should check in individually.

#### **24. Can I add an individual who is not my family member (e.g. friend or co-worker) into my check-in list?**
While this feature is primarily meant for family members, you may add any individual into your check-in list if:

- a.	All members are staying in the same place of residence; and/or 
- b.	All of you travel as a group to and from the location by the same mode of transport.

In the situation where you need to check-in with a friend or co-worker, e.g. if you are staying together as roommates, please ensure that you have their explicit permission and knowledge to add their NRIC/FIN to your check-in list. Please take note that when you use the group check-in feature, you are making a declaration on behalf of others.

#### **25. Can I add my domestic helper into the check-in list?**
You may add your domestic helper to your check-in list by entering his / her FIN number indicated on his / her work permit.

#### **26. What should I do when a family member, whom I have checked in together with, leaves the venue much earlier than I do?**
We advise users to plan ahead – if you are likely to check out separately, please check-in separately. In case of an unplanned situation, the user who has conducted the check-in will be responsible for ensuring accuracy in his/her family members’ movement. To support contact tracing efforts, the user should ensure that the check-out is only performed when the last person leaves the venue.
