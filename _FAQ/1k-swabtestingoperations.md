## **<ins>Background Information</ins>**

#### **1. Why is MOH conducting testing operations for food delivery personnel?**
To facilitate the progressive reopening of social and economic activities, MOH will be offering testing to identified community groups such as food delivery personnel.  

There is currently no evidence that this group is of a higher risk prevalence. MOH will be offering complimentary tests to them given the nature of their working environment, such as the high frequency of interactions with members of the public. We strongly encourage all food delivery personnel to come forward for testing to provide assurance to their loved ones and those around them. The costs of these tests will be fully borne by the government.

#### **2. What other groups will be tested?**
As a start, MOH will be conducting testing operations for Point-to-Point (P2P) drivers, food delivery personnel, vendors servicing dormitories, as well as hawkers and wet market vendors. MOH will progressively review and expand complimentary testing to other identified groups.

#### **3. How long will these testing operations be conducted for?**
Over the next few months, the government will be setting up more temporary screening centres islandwide to avail the testing to more people in the identified community groups. For a start, temporary screening centres will be set up in the Ang Mo Kio GRC, Kebun Baru SMC and Yio Chu Kang SMC on 15 Oct 2020 (Thurs) and 16 Oct 2020 (Fri). These screening centres would be available for the testing of food delivery personnel, hawkers, coffeeshop operators, stallholders and stall assistants around the area.

#### **4. When will the swab testing exercise for other regions commence?**
The testing operations will be progressively rolled out to different regions of Singapore, and information on the test schedules and locations of the screening centres will be provided when ready.

#### **5. Is the swab test compulsory?**
The swab test is not compulsory, but we strongly encourage food delivery personnel to be tested so that they can take measures to protect themselves and their loved ones if tested positive. They will also be able to receive prompt medical treatment if required.

#### **6. Are there any rewards/ incentives for food delivery personnel who come forward for testing?**
The government will bear the full costs of the swab tests. By stepping forward for testing, food delivery personnel can also provide assurance to their loved ones and those around them.

#### **7. Is the swab test painful?**
A new method of swabbing will be used. This new method of swabbing is more comfortable. In addition, swab test assistants are well-trained and experienced, and will ensure a smooth and painless process as far as possible.

#### **8. Is there an age limit to taking the swab test?**
No, there is no age limit. Anyone above the age of 12 can undergo a swab test.

#### **9. For those who have previously tested negative/positive for COVID-19 and are already well now, do they still need to be tested?**
Food delivery personnel who have previously tested negative for COVID-19 are strongly encouraged to register for a swab test. 

Individuals who have tested positive from COVID-19 do not need to be retested for COVID-19 if it is still within 180 days from the onset of infection.

## **<ins>Registration for Testing</ins>**

#### **10. How should food delivery personnel register for a swab appointment?**
Pre-registration is mandatory due to the limited testing availability. Interested food delivery personnel can access FormSG at this <a href="https://go.gov.sg/fooddeliveryswabtest" target="_blank">link</a> to register for a testing slot. For the testing operations in the Ang Mo Kio region, registration will open from 9 October 2020, 1700 hours to 13 October 2020, 1900 hours or when the slots are fully filled, whichever is earlier.

The confirmed appointment date and time will be communicated to them through email. They are also strongly encouraged to keep to their assigned appointment slot.

#### **11. Is the testing operations open to all food delivery personnel?**
This community testing will be available to food delivery personnel of key food delivery platforms and food chains, who are some of the largest employers of food delivery personnel. These include Deliveroo, foodpanda, GrabFood and McDonald’s.

#### **12. If a food delivery personnel who registered for the test is unable to make it for the allocated slot for the test, can he/she reschedule his/her appointment?**
Food delivery personnel are strongly advised to keep to their assigned appointment slots. Those who miss their appointments slots can still go for the swab at the appointed site, during the period of the testing exercise. However, this is subject to the availability of tests that day.

#### **13. What if a food delivery personnel who registered for the test is on Medical Leave? Would he/she need to go for the swab test?**
Individuals on medical leave are encouraged to stay at home to rest. Individuals who display fever or upper respiratory tract related symptoms (cough, runny nose, sore throat, etc.) should see a doctor immediately.

#### **14. Can food delivery personnel still take the swab test if they did not pre-register for it?**
Due to limited testing capacity, pre-registration for the swab test is mandatory for this pilot; walk-ins are not allowed. There is a limit of 100 food delivery personnel each day at each location.

#### **15. What if the food delivery personnel has just returned from Home Quarantine Order, Stay- Home Notice or 5-day Medical Leave? Would they need to go for the swab test?**
Individuals returning from Home Quarantine Order (HQO), Stay Home Notice (SHN) or 5-day Medical Leave can take the swab test only if their HQO, SHN or 5-day Medical Leave has ended by the date of the scheduled swab appointment. Individuals currently serving their HQO/SHN must remain isolated at their place of residence.

## **<ins>On the day of the swab test</ins>**

#### **16. What identification will food delivery personnel need to bring along for their swab test?**
They are required to produce proof of identity as a food delivery personnel (e.g. through delivery apps, staff pass) and a form of photo identification with their NRIC number (e.g. NRIC, Vocational Licence, Driver’s Licence).

#### **17. How long will the entire swabbing process take?**
The swab process typically ranges between 10 and 15 mins. Food delivery personnel are required to register for an appointment and should keep to their allocated appointment slot where possible. We seek the understanding of registrants that there might be a waiting time before their turn for the swabbing process.

## **<ins>Results from COVID-19 Testing</ins>**

#### **18. How long do the food delivery personnel need to wait to receive the results of their test?**
Test results will be available within 2-3 working days from the date of swab. MOH/HPB will inform food delivery personnel their test results via SMS, when ready. They can also check their results via HPB's HealthHub.

#### **19. Can food delivery personnel continue to provide services while they are waiting for the results of their swab test?**
Yes, food delivery personnel are free to carry on their activities after the swab. They should continue to practise the same standard COVID-19 precautionary measures, i.e. frequent washing of hands with soap – especially before eating or handling food, after toilet visits, or when hands are dirtied by respiratory secretion after coughing or sneezing; practising safe distancing; and the wearing of mask when leaving the house for essential purposes.

#### **20. What happens if a food delivery personnel is tested positive for COVID-19?**
Positive cases will be contacted by MOH. They will be advised on the appropriate treatment, further tests as well as quarantine arrangements required. They will also be interviewed for identification of close contacts, so that precautionary measures can be taken. 

Food delivery personnel who are placed under quarantine or put on Stay-Home Notice (SHN) will receive a $100/day allowance for the duration of the quarantine/SHN. Those who require further financial assistance can apply to The Courage Fund. 

#### **21. What happens to the close contacts (e.g. colleagues, friends, family), if a food delivery personnel is tested positive for COVID-19?**
Close contacts of the positive case will be contacted by MOH officials and will be advised on the measures to take. 

The close contacts are advised to monitor their health closely and seek medical attention if they have fever, cough or runny nose. They should also call the clinic ahead of their visit and inform the doctor of their symptoms. 

#### **22. Will the food delivery companies be informed of the results of their food delivery personnel?**
Yes, the companies will be notified if their food delivery personnel have tested positive for COVID-19, so that the necessary precautionary measures can be taken. 

MOH will work with the companies to take the necessary public health precautionary measures to prevent further spread of the virus, including measures such as disinfecting of the areas exposed to the virus.

#### **23. Is it compulsory for positive cases to go to the hospital via the arranged transportation? Can they go to the hospital on their own (i.e. commute on their own).**
Positive cases will be contacted by MOH and advised on the necessary follow-up measures to be taken. Transport will be arranged to send them to the hospital or community care facilities so that they can receive adequate care and treatment. They will not be allowed to take their own mode of transport in order to ensure other members in the community are not infected.

#### **24. Can positive cases bring their family member with them when they are being conveyed to the hospital/community care facility?**
It is not advisable for positive cases to bring any family member along with them as it is important to maintain appropriate safe distance from their loved ones and those around them.

#### **25. How long must the positive cases stay in the hospital?**
The duration of stay depends on their condition. The doctor will be able to advise them accordingly.
