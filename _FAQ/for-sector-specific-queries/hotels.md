#### **1. Are staycations allowed?**
Hotels may apply to STB to resume the provision of accommodation to guests for the purposes of leisure (e.g. staycations). Any hotel that wishes to apply must comply with the safe management measures required for hotels. Please refer to the advisory for <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/advisory-for-hotels.html" target="_blank">hotels</a> for the full list of requirements.

Hotels must submit their application to STB for assessment. Hotels may resume the provision of accommodation to guests for the purposes of leisure and related marketing efforts only after receiving approval from MTI. 

The list of approved hotels can be found at <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/permitted-tourism-businesses.html">https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/permitted-tourism-businesses.html</a>.

#### **2. Can Hotels resume operations for event venues?**

Classes and training by permitted enterprises conducting an education business[^1]  must be limited to no more than 50 individuals including the trainer(s). Safe management measures must be implemented, including ensuring at least 1 metre safe distance between all individuals, or if individuals must be less than 1 metre apart, they should be in groups of no more than 8, with at least 1 metre distance between groups. A record of the groups of 8 must be kept for not less than 28 days after the day the record is made.

#### **3. Are hotels required to submit an application for General Exemption (GE) of activities for F&B establishments, spas, pools and gyms?**
Hotels that have been closed and are not seeking approval from MTI for staycations for the time being will need to apply to MTI for general exemption before the resumption of these other businesses.

#### **4. Once a hotel has received approval to re-open for staycations, does it have to submit a separate application to re-open other businesses (e.g. F&B, spas, pools, gyms) within its premises?**
A separate application for General Exemption is not required. Once a hotel receives approval from MTI to re-open for staycations, they are only required to submit via https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg the collective number of workers who are working on-site at the various facilities. This will need to be done within 2 weeks of the date of resumption of on-site operations for staycations.
