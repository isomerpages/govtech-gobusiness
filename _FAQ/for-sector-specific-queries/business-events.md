#### **1. What constitutes a MICE event?**
For the purpose of the expansion of MICE pilot events announced on 7 September 2020, MICE events refer to business-oriented meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions which excludes work-related events such as conferences, seminars, corporate retreats, Annual General Meetings (AGMs) and Extraordinary General Meetings (EGMs) that are targeted at internal audiences such as employees as well as other events which are predominantly social in nature. For more information, please refer <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/faq-on-covid-19.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **2. When will MICE events be allowed to resume? Can I apply to do so?**
In line with the safe and gradual resumption of economic activities in Singapore, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) will start accepting applications for organisers to pilot Meetings, Incentives, Conventions and Exhibitions (MICE)[^1] events of up to 250 attendees from 1 October 2020. STB and the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) will review all MICE event proposals, and event organisers may proceed only upon obtaining MTIâ€™s approval. For more information on the application procedure, please refer <a href="https://www.stb.gov.sg/content/stb/en/home-pages/faq-on-covid-19.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

#### **3. What is the role of the Event Organiser and Event Venue? Who would be penalised if Safe Management Measures (SMMs) are contravened?**
Both the Event Organiser and Event Venue are jointly responsible for the events taking place under their purview. If SMMs are contravened, Enforcement Officers will investigate the facts and circumstances to determine which party is liable, or if both parties are liable.
