#### **1. How long will Phase Two last for?**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to ease measures in a gradual and calibrated manner, until we reach a new normal in Phase Three. Phase Three is the state in which we expect to remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is developed.
 
Over the course of Phase Two, some higher risk activities and settings that remain closed at the start of Phase Two will gradually be allowed to open, when they are able to implement adequate safe management measures. Prevailing limits on gathering sizes may also be relaxed in a gradual manner.
