#### **1. How long will Phase Two last for?**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will continue to monitor the situation closely, with the aim of continuing to ease measures in a gradual and calibrated manner, until we reach a new normal in Phase Three. Phase Three is the state in which we expect to remain until an effective vaccine or treatment for COVID-19 is developed.
 
Over the course of Phase Two, some higher risk activities and settings that remain closed at the start of Phase Two will gradually be allowed to open, when they are able to implement adequate safe management measures. Prevailing limits on gathering sizes may also be relaxed in a gradual manner. 

#### **2. How do I know if my company is allowed to resume operations?**
The lists of businesses (and the corresponding Singapore Standard Industrial Classification (SSIC) codes) that may operate from 2 June 2020 (Phase One) and 19 June 2020 (Phase Two) can be found <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/guides/permittedserviceslist2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> respectively. Businesses in these lists do not need to apply to MTI for exemption before resuming operations. They are required to submit the number of workers who are working on-site using the <a href="https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg">GoBusiness portal</a> within two weeks of the date of resumption of operations.

If you cannot recall your companyâ€™s primary SSIC code or are unsure of the classification of your business activity, you can visit <a href="https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/">BizFile+</a> and login with your CorpPass to retrieve your primary SSIC code. Thereafter, you can check this against the list of permitted services. 

#### **3. How did MTI decide which companies should resume operations?**
The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced on 19 May that we will exit the Circuit Breaker and resume activities in a phased manner from 2 June to minimise the risk of a resurgence in COVID-19 community transmission. In Phase One starting from 2 June, the MTF gradually allowed more workers to return to work, starting with businesses that operate in settings with lower transmission risks, or that do not require interactions with large groups of people. In Phase Two starting from 19 June, we will allow the resumption of a broad range of activities, including the reopening of physical outlets of retail businesses, as well as the resumption of food and beverage dine-in, personal health and wellness, and home-based services. 

Before resuming activities, businesses must comply with the requirements for Safe Management Measures and any sector-specific requirements which apply to them.
