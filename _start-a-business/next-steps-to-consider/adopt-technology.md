If you have just started your business or are new to digital technology, you can now take up a [Start Digital Package](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/smes-go-digital/start-digital-pack){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to give you a head start in going digital. You can benefit from starting with the right foundational digital tools by taking up any two solutions, at no cost for at least six months with a minimum 18-month contract period, from these categories:

- Accounting\*
- HR management system & payroll
- Digital marketing
- Digital transactions
- Cybersecurity

\*[Selected accounting software](https://www.iras.gov.sg/taxes/corporate-income-tax/form-c-s-form-c-s-(lite)-form-c-filing/using-accounting-software-to-prepare-file-form-c-s-seamlessly){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} can automatically prepare and file statutory returns (Income Tax Returns and Annual Returns) and XBRL financial statements (simplified XBRL) directly to IRAS and ACRA. This means that you can file independently to both agencies simply by using the software.

### Productivity Solutions Grants

The [Productivity Solutions Grant (PSG)](/productivity-solutions-grant/) supports companies keen on using IT solutions and equipment to enhance business processes by providing up to 80% funding support. PSG covers sector-specific solutions and solutions across industries, such as customer management, data analytics, financial management and inventory tracking.

### Register a domain name

You can register a domain name (ending with ".com.sg" or ".sg") with any of the authorised registrars accredited by the [Singapore Network Information Centre (SGNIC)](https://www.sgnic.sg/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} after registering your business.
