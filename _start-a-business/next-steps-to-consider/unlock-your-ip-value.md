## Unlock the value of your Intellectual Property

![Protect your ideas](/images/start/StartSJ_StartSJ_TrademarksIP.jpg)

Intangible assets now account for 90% of all business value, as cited in an Ocean Tomo study. Your inventions, designs and representations of your brand are part of your businessâ€™ intangible assets and intellectual property (IA/IP) that should be protected.

Whether you are a budding entrepreneur, a start-up, a SME or an MNC, protecting and managing your IP can help your business grow. Having a strong IP portfolio can open up commercial opportunities for your business such as research & development (R&D) partnerships, securing investments, licensing and franchising. Find out more about monetising your IP [here](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/manage-ip/monetise-ip){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

Common forms of IP are trade marks (representation of your brands), patents (your inventions) and designs. Find out more about intangible assets and IP [here](https://www.ipos.gov.sg/about-ip){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

Generally, a good time to file for protection of your IP is before launching your product or service, so that no one can take advantage of your IP without your permission. If you are considering filing a patent application to protect your invention, it should preferably be done before you disclose your invention publicly to third parties (eg: potential collaborators) to avoid failing to satisfy one of the qualifying criteria.
