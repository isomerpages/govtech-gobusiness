### How to register a business

There are two ways to register your business:

1. [Log in to BizFile+](https://www.bizfile.gov.sg/ngbbizfileinternet/faces/oracle/webcenter/portalapp/pages/BizfileHomepage.jspx#/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} with your Singpass to submit the application online. All proposed persons associated with the business will need to endorse their consent online via BizFile+ first before the business can be registered, or

2. Engage a registered filing agent (e.g: law firm, accounting firm or corporate secretarial firm) to submit an online application on your behalf.

The pre-requisites, information and supporting documents needed for the application to register the business will vary, depending on the business structure type. Click on the respective business structure to find out more.

### Unique Entity Number (UEN) and Business Profile

Upon successful registration of your new business, your business will be issued a [Unique Entity Number (UEN)](https://www.uen.gov.sg/ueninternet/faces/pages/admin/aboutUEN.jspx){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. The UEN is your business' unique identification number that will be used in all transactions with government agencies.

A [free copy of Business Profile](https://www.acra.gov.sg/about-bizfile/updates-and-announcements/provision-of-free-business-profiles){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for your business will be emailed to the person filing the application.
