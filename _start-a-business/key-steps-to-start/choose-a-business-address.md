### Business Address

When registering your business with ACRA, you must provide a business address. A business address cannot be a P.O. Box address.

### Residential & Alternate Addresses

Other than your business address, all business owners and company officers must also provide their residential address at the point of registration. These addresses are made publicly available when the public purchases information about the business entity.

If you wish to protect your privacy, you may submit an Alternate Address for a fee of $40. You are still required to submit your residential address for ACRAâ€™s records.

The Alternate Address will be shown on public records instead of your personal residential address. However, please ensure you can be contacted at your Alternate Address.
