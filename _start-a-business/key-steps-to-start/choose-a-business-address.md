## Step 2: Choose a business address

![Choose Biz Address](/images/start/StartSJ_BusinessAddress.jpg)

A business address is the place where you carry out your business. A P.O. Box address cannot be used as a business address.

All business owners and company officers must provide their residential address at the point of registration. These addresses are made publicly available when the public purchases information about the business entity.

If you wish to protect your privacy, you can may submit an Alternate Address for a fee of $40. You are still required to submit your residential address for ACRA's records.

The Alternate Address will be shown on public records instead of your personal residential address. However, please ensure you can be contacted at your Alternate Address at all times.
