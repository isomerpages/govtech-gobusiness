<p>Major payment institutions are licensed and regulated under the Payment Services Act ("PS Act") to provide payment services without being subject to the specified thresholds.</p>
 <p>The thresholds are set out in section 6(5) of the PS Act. In summary, these are:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>S$3 million monthly transactions for any payment service (other than e-money account issuance and money-changing services).</li>
 <li>S$6 million monthly transactions for two or more payment services (other than e-money account issuance and money-changing services).</li>
 <li>S$5 million of daily outstanding e-money</li>
 </ul>
 <p>Note that entities that provide only money-changing services should hold a money-changing licence instead. Entities that provide payment services under the specified thresholds should hold a standard payment institution licence.</p>
