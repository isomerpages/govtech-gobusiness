<H3>Application Details</H3>

<p><strong>Fire Safety Certificate</strong><br />A Fire Safety Certificate (FSC) provides for the safety of the building's occupants. Therefore, owners and their Qualified Persons (QP) whom they have engaged for their fire safety works are required to apply and obtain the FSC before using or occupying the premises. The FSC is only issued after full completion of all fire safety works in the project. Failure to comply with this is an offence under the Fire Safety Act and the owner is liable to court action.</p>
<p><strong>Temporary Fire Permit</strong><br />A building owner may also apply and obtain a Temporary Fire Permit (TFP) for a limited period to occupy or use the premises, prior to obtaining the FSC. The TFP is only issued on condition that the fire safety works of the project has been satisfactorily completed with very minor outstanding issues left to be complied with. The timeframe to obtain the FSC after issuance of the TFP will depend on the size, type and complexity of the project. Normally, a maximum of 6 months will be granted.</p>
