    - title: Am I allowed to operate at full capacity during this time?  Or must we limit work to specific hours or at certain manpower limits?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure that all employees whose job functions can be performed from home should work from home. For those that are unable to work from home, employers should stagger start times and allow flexible workplace hours. Employees should not be cross deployed to other worksites. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

    - title: Can F&B establishments allow dine-in options?
      content: |
        F&B establishments are allowed to continue food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613.

        From 22 November 2021, up to 5 fully vaccinated persons from the same regardless of household, will be allowed to dine-in together at F&B establishments as long as they have met requirements for Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs  (VDS). Unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2009) may be included within the group of 5 persons as long as all the children are from the same household.

        Groups of up to 5 persons will also be allowed to dine-in at hawker centres and coffee shops* where full VDS checks have been implemented. The initial batch of hawker centres and coffee shops that are ready have started such checks from 23 November 2021, and more will do so when ready. Otherwise, dining-in at hawker centres and coffee shops without full VDS checks will remain at groups of up to 2 persons who are fully vaccinated. Strict enforcement action will be taken against coffeeshops that allow groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons to dine in without implementing the necessary checks as well as against individuals who breach this rule.
        
        VDS eligibility criteria are as follows:
        
          a.	Fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines (e.g. Pfizer-BioNTech/Comirnaty, Moderna, AstraZeneca-SKBio, Serum Institute of India, Janssen, Sinopharm, Sinovac-CoronaVac) including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective and had their vaccination records captured in MOH's national IT systems<sup>1</sup>; or

          b.	Recovered from COVID-19, i.e. less than 270 days of first positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result obtained in Singapore, and can provide a valid Pre-Event Test (PET) exemption notice from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider; or

          c.	Have a valid negative PET result<sup>2</sup> obtained from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider in the past 24 hours.

        Dine-in is not allowed if any individual does not meet the eligibility criteria above. Allowing this would be an offence.

        *These refer to F&B establishments with SFA coffeeshop/ eating house/canteen licenses that are not substantially enclosed by a permanent barrier. 

        <sup>1</sup> Please refer to [MOH's Post Vaccination Matters website](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/vaccination/faqs---post-vaccination-matters){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information.
        <sup>2</sup> Unvaccinated individuals aged 13 or above must have a valid negative ART or PCR result from an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider within the last 24 hours. Refer to [go.gov.sg/swabproviders](https://go.gov.sg/swabproviders){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the list of MOH-approved COVID-19 test providers.

    - title: Can work-related events continue to be held at F&B establishments?
      content: |
        Work-related events (both non customer-facing and customer-facing) can be held within the workplace premises and third-party venues. Such events are not permitted at public and common areas such as mall atriums, public transport nodes, HDB estates and common corridors. <u><b>Prevailing guidelines for the respective event venues will apply</b></u>*.

        (i) Non customer-facing events (e.g. promotion/human resource event for workers):

          * Meals should not be the main feature. Enterprises should avoid holding events over mealtimes. In addition, the food must be served in individual portions, and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. Participants should put on their masks as soon as they have finished eating or drinking.

          * If a F&B establishment organises an event in its premises that involves any participant who is not a worker of, or who does not regularly deliver goods or services to the F&B establishment, should meals be provided, then every participant must meet VDS requirements. 

          * If the F&B establishment is a venue for an event organised by a third party, should meals be provided, then every participant must meet VDS requirements.

          * Such events held in F&B establishments are subject to a cap of 50 persons or less, depending on venue capacity and subject to safe distancing requirements of at least one-metre spacing between individuals.

        (ii) Customer-facing events (e.g. product launches, outlet opening):

          * Meals should not be the main feature of the event. Event organisers should also avoid holding events over mealtimes.  Food or drinks should only be served if incidental to the work-related event (e.g. product launch extends over lunchtime). 

          * Food and drinks must be served in individual portions and participants must be seated while consuming the food and drinks. There should be no intermingling between the groups. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating and drinking.

          * If meals are provided, then every participant must meet VDS requirements.

          * Such events organised by F&B establishments within their own F&B premises are subject to the maximum number of individuals that the venue may accommodate after safe distancing measures are adhered to.

          * Events organised by external parties (where the F&B premises now function as a third-party venue) are subject to a cap of 50 persons (excluding the F&B establishment's service staff) or up to the venue capacity with safe distancing requirements in place, whichever is lower.

          * Event participants can be in groups of up to 5 persons. There must be at least one-metre spacing between groups.

        *<b>Note: Work-related events held in F&B establishments must comply with the SMM requirements for F&B establishments.</b>

    - title: For children, what kind of declaration is considered acceptable? Can parents verbally declare that their children live in the same address or they need a written document to prove that? If a written document is required, what kind of document will that be？
      content: |
        For children under 15 who do not have a NRIC or SingPass, a verbal declaration by the family on the household status would be accepted. Individuals are reminded that strict enforcement action will be taken against anyone who pretends to be from the same household. 

    - title: Can a group of unvaccinated children dine together without an adult?
      content: |
        Children under 12 will be allowed to dine-in at F&B establishments. However, if more than 1 unvaccinated child is in the dine-in group, all unvaccinated children must be from the same household. Unvaccinated children do not need to be accompanied by an adult when dining in.

    - title: Can F&B establishment allow in their premises social gatherings with more than 5 persons?
      content: |
        Social gatherings or interactions involving more than 5 persons are not allowed. 

        Exceptions can only be made if all members of the group are from the same household, i.e. have the same place of residence (families living in different places of residence are not from the same household). However, they will need to be seated in separate groups/tables, with no more than 5 persons per group/table, with at least one-metre spacing maintained between these groups. F&B establishments are required to verify customers' claims that they are from the same household, and can decline service at their discretion.

      content: |
        To facilitate the collection/delivery of test kits, F&B establishments should submit full details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as soon as possible. Establishments must consolidate the collection/delivery of kits to a single location for each UEN. Depending on the size of your workforce, the kits may be arranged as a delivery to your address instead.

    - title: How do I create an account on SRS to upload the employees' swab test results?
      content: |
        For unregistered F&B establishments, please submit your details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This registration would facilitate the set-up of companies' SRS accounts and arrange for the delivery or collection of ART kits.
        
        Enterprises with multiple outlets must consolidate their submission and submit a single Order Form for each UEN. Enterprises will be responsible for the dissemination of the test kits to their respective outlets. The Point-of-Contact<sup>3</sup> (POC) indicated in the form must be the employee who will be responsible for both self-collection of the test kits, and the uploading of FET results to the SRS account.

        After the creation of the SRS account, the POC will need to upload the particulars of their supervisors. With the successful upload of their particulars, supervisors will be able to submit test results through the unique company SRS link.

        <sup>3</sup> Establishments are also able to nominate an alternate POC, if they wish to do so.

    - title: How do I add entries for new supervisors/update supervisors' details on the SRS? 
      content: |
        Once the company's SRS account has been created, the POC may log into the account to upload supervisors' details, as well as make edits subsequently. The upload of supervisors' details would give them access to submit test results through the unique company SRS link. 
    
    - title: Is there a deadline for employers to key in the test results onto the SRS portal? 
      content: |
        Establishments are required to upload the results of the outlet workers' swab tests to the SRS on the same day as the tests are taken (within 24 hours).

    - title: What are the latest measures that retail establishments and lifestyle-related services need to note?
      content: |
        Retail establishments and lifestyle-related services are to comply with the following: 

        a.	Social gatherings are allowed to comprise up to 5 persons. In line with this, retail establishments are to ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers (of up to 5 persons). Malls should also ensure that crowds do not gather at atriums or common spaces, and discourage the consumption of food and drinks at such spaces.

        b.	The occupancy limit for malls and large standalone stores will be one person per10 sqm of Gross Floor Area (GFA).  

        c.	The operating capacity of Commercial Family Entertainment Centres (FECs) will be at a maximum of one person per 10 sqm of usable space or 50% operating capacity, whichever is lower.     FEC operators should take note that group booking comprising unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below old must be from the same household. 

        d.	Services and activities in higher-risk settings, which require masks to be removed, are allowed to resume in groups of up to 5 persons if customers are fully vaccinated. These include personal care services (e.g. facial treatments, make-up services and saunas), Food & Beverage (F&B) dine-in and indoor high-intensity/ mask-off sports services. 

        e.	It is mandatory for establishments providing personal care services (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) to place all employees on a regular Fast and Easy Testing Rostered Routine Testing (FET RRT) regime using tests such as antigen rapid test (ART), regardless of their vaccination status. 

          *	The frequency of the FET RRT is now once every 7 days to allow for earlier detection and ringfencing of cases. 

          * By 27 September 2021, all individuals working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets<sup>4</sup> must also undergo testing once every 7 days under the FET RRT regime.  

          *	This includes both part-time and full-time employees, as well as third-party contracted staff and all those who work on the premises (e.g. cleaners, promoters). Business owners and store managers who work at the workplace must also undergo FET. Individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection in the past 270 days are exempted from the FET Requirement. Establishments can refer to the following Gobusiness portal link for more details.  
          
          * From 1 October 2021, all unvaccinated individuals working at establishments providing personal care services have to undergo testing twice a week using ART to mitigate risk of transmission to the public, under the “Vaccinate or Regular Test” (VoRT) regime. This is also applicable to those working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets. The tests can be similarly done through employer-led supervised self-swabs. A test done under the existing FET RRT, which is a supervised FET, also counts towards this requirement. 

          *	The costs of additional testing required for unvaccinated employees are to be fully borne by users or the enterprises.

          *	The government will subsidise tests for individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines.

          *	All vaccinated employees working at establishments providing personal care services must continue with the prevailing FET RRT regime (testing once every 7 days). 

          *	Employers may wish to refer to [MOM's Advisory on COVID-19 vaccination at the workplace for more information](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

          <sup>4</sup> This refers to all mall management employees as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open. However, operators must practise safe management and safe distancing measures. They must ensure that common touchpoints are disinfected frequently.

    - title: Are playgrounds/ indoor playgrounds permitted to open? 
      content: |
        Common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail stores or malls can remain open. Operators of these play areas must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers.

    - title: Are personal care services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Personal care services that require the removal of masks are allowed to resume if customers are fully vaccinated. These include beauty services and/or activities offered at retail outlets.

        Examples of such services include facial treatments, saunas, makeup services and portions of threading and facial grooming services, which require customers' masks to be removed

    - title: Are massage/spa services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Massage services are still allowed to operate within private rooms. However, customers will need to have their masks on at all times.

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing?   
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests Rostered Routine Testing (FET RRT) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART), regardless of vaccination status. These include: 

        a. All individuals working at F&B establishments providing dine-in services;

        b. All last-mile food delivery personnel; 
        
        c. Personal care services (e.g. nail services, massage establishments, hairdressing); 
        
        d. Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked;
        
        e. All individuals working in malls, large standalone stores and supermarket outlets<sup>5</sup> 

        The above include part-time and full-time employees, third-party contracted staff, and all other workers who work on the premises, e.g. cleaners, contractors, subcontractors, promoters).

        The regular FET for staff in these settings is mandatory. The frequency of the FET is once every 7 days to facilitate the earlier detection of cases.

        <sup>5</sup> This refers to all mall management employees as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops.

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing?   
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risks, as clients/patrons are unmasked or where there is prolonged contact between individuals. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo a 7-day regular FET with effect from 13 September 2021.

    - title: I understand that the FET regime is mandatory from 15 July. I have received my ART test kits but am experiencing technical issues with the Swab Registration System (SRS) (e.g. unable to log into the system/ upload supervisors/ upload results). What should I do? Can I still continue to operate?   
      content: |
        You can continue to operate. However, you should reach out to HPB's SRS technical support at [AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg](mailto:AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg) or [+65 6876 5830](tel:+6568765830) if you are facing technical issues with the SRS. Once you have received your ART test kits, you should proceed with the testing of your staff and keep a record of the results. Once the SRS system issues have been resolved, you will need to upload these backdated results into the system. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do?
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses with at least 2 staff to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 

        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers or establishments with only 1 employee) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. 

        F&B businesses can refer to SFA's guide for onboarding for testing at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) ([https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments)). Please refer to the section on "How to onboard by Quick Test Centre?” on the steps required.

        For small businesses in retail malls (e.g., pushcarts or sole proprietors) with only 1 employee who are unable to organize the supervised self-swabs on their own, please ask your mall management team if they can assist with onboarding you as part of their weekly test. For this arrangement, your weekly ART result will be submitted under the UEN of the mall management team. Alternatively, similar small businesses in retail malls may group together and nominate one UEN which the results will be uploaded. Such businesses may also appoint trusted non-staff persons to supervise the self-swabs and submit the results.

    - title: Can supervision be done virtually?   
      content: |
        Yes, supervision of employee's self-swab can be done virtually as alternatives to on-site supervision. Possible alternative approaches include a) virtual-live supervision or b) post-swab video supervision. 

        a. Virtual-live supervision involves real-time supervision of the swabbing process through virtual platforms. Employees can annotate the details (name and timestamp) on the test kit and perform the self-swab. Employees can exit the virtual platform after the swab is done and submit a photo of the kit result to the supervisor thereafter. 

        b. Post-swab video supervision involves employees taking a video of themselves self-swabbing and submitting the recorded video alongside a photo of the test kit result. Both the photo and the video should have a timestamp and employers should check all the videos submitted.

      content: |
        There is no need to conduct VDS checks for customers doing takeaways. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that these customers do not consume food and drinks on the premises. There should be clearly demarcated waiting areas for customers doing takeaways.

    - title: Do I need to do SafeEntry at my F&B establishment? 
      content: |
        TraceTogether-only SafeEntry must be implemented for all dine-in customers and visitors at F&B establishments, including at food courts. Delivery personnel picking up food orders and take-away customers are not required to do SafeEntry as their presence at the F&B establishment is transient.  

        All establishments must require their employees and vendors to do SafeEntry check-in via TT-only SE. 

    - title: For VDS, I understand that the children in the group must be from the same household. What about the other individuals in the group? Can we be from different households? 
      content: |
        Yes, eligible individuals (13 years old and above) in the group can be from different households; they need not be from the same household as the children. Within the group, only children (12 and under) need to be from the same household.

        3. Vendors

        4. Part-time workers

        5. Third-party contracted workers

        6. Food delivery personnel and couriers

        From 1 January 2022, those who choose not to be vaccinated can no longer use a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) to enter VDS settings such as shopping malls. Only those who are fully vaccinated, have recovered from COVID-19, are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme or are children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2009) will be allowed to enter settings where VDS is implemented.

    - title: Who are exempted from VDS at malls? 
      content: |
        Apart from the mall workers and individuals entering the mall for work reasons (e.g. Food Delivery Riders, technicians), unvaccinated individuals who are visiting the malls for medical services (doctors, dentists and registered TCM practioners, and their caregivers) will be exempted from VDS.

        Unvaccinated caregivers who need to drop off or pick up children from preschools and childcare will be exempted from VDS. However, they need to obtain letter of support from the institution and produce it to the mall security officers.

    - title: I am an unvaccinated individual. Can I walk in and visit clinics or medical institutions located within mall premise without appointment? 
      content: |
        No, unvaccinated individuals should have an appointment before they are allowed to enter the mall. They may request the clinic to send them a SMS to confirm their appointment quickly.

    - title: Are unvaccinated caregivers allowed to bring their children below 12 years old for enrichment or tuition classes in malls?

      content: |
        No, you do not need to. VDS is to be implemented for personal care services that require customers to remove their masks for the duration of the service. For example, make-up services, facial treatments and saunas. 

    - title: Can I allow a foreign customer who received his/her PSAR-approved vaccines overseas and provides proof of this vaccination to dine in my F&B establishment/ partake in personal care services provided at my shop?
      content: |
        All individuals aged 12 years and above who have been fully vaccinated overseas with any vaccines approved under the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) needs to get their overseas vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). This includes Singaporean Citizens (SC), Singapore Permanent Residents (PR), Long-Term Pass Holder (LTPH) (e.g. Long-Term Visitor Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass, S Pass, Dependent Pass, Student Pass) and Short-Term Pass Holders (STPH).

        If their overseas vaccination documents are not in English, they will need to get the documents translated by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country that issued the document. Both the original overseas vaccination document and translated document must be brought along when visiting a private healthcare provider in Singapore for serology testing.
        
        After arriving in Singapore, the individual will need to visit a healthcare provider who will do the following:
        
        1. Review the individual's overseas vaccination documentation - either the original hard copy vaccination certificate or digital vaccination certificate (with translated document where applicable).

        2. Perform a serology test.
        
        3. Update the individual's overseas COVID-19 vaccination record(s) to NIR as long as the individual (i) has overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation, and (ii) whose serology test result is positive.

        4. Individuals will see their vaccinations status on TraceTogether or HealthHub app within 24 hours after clinic has notified NIR of their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages. 

    - title: How do I conduct VDS verification for foreign visitors?
      content: |
        All travellers, including those on VTL, will be required to download the TraceTogether app or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

        They will need to take a serology test at the following clinics (go.gov.sg/clinicsforserology) to have their vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). Following this, their vaccination status will be reflected in the TraceTogether app or token.

    - title: Are there concessions for individuals who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines? 
      content: |
        From 1 December 2021, those who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme will be able to enter shopping malls, dine in at F&B establishments and participate in personal care services (such as facials and saunas) and high-intensity sports/exercise activities and classes that require masks to be removed. 

        They will need to present a hard copy memo issued by a General Practitioner (GP) clinic, public or private healthcare institution, along with a government-issued photo identification card for entry into these premises. More details on the criteria for medical ineligibility can be found [here](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/calibrated-adjustments-in-stabilisation-phase_8Nov2021){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: Will the government pay for the mandatory testing for employees?
      content: |
        The FET regime is mandatory for employees who interact with customers in higher-risk mask-off settings, regardless of vaccination status. As such, ART kits will be provided for Employer-Supervised Self-Swab (ESSS) and the costs for these kits will be borne by the government until 31 December 2021.

        From 1 October 2021, employees working in selected sectors (including F&B) were mandated to be fully vaccinated or have to undergo regular, twice-weekly testing. **The government will subsidise the cost of tests for unvaccinated individuals who are medically ineligible for vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme.** Enterprises should submit a consolidated declaration of their workers' vaccination status at https://go.gov.sg/mi-declaration for your UEN.

        However, with the implementation of Workforce Vaccination Measures from 1 January 2022, the twice-weekly testing regime for unvaccinated individuals will be phased out at the same time.

    - title: Should F&B/spa/gym staff who are unvaccinated be redeployed to other roles? How is the government protecting the jobs of unvaccinated staff affected by this policy ('vaccinate or regular test') and prevent employers from displacing/letting them go?
      content: |
        Starting from 1 January 2022, only employees who are vaccinated, or have recovered from COVID-19 within 270 days, can return to the workplace. All unvaccinated employees will not be allowed at the workplace unless they have a negative Pre-Event Testing (PET) result. The PET negative result must be valid for the duration that employees are required to be present at the workplace. 

        For unvaccinated employees whose work can be performed at home, employers may allow them to continue to work from home. For those whose work cannot be performed from home, employers can: 
        
        * Allow them to continue in the existing job with PET done at employees' own expense and own time; or
        
        * Redeploy them to suitable jobs which can be done from home if such jobs are available, with renumeration commensurate with the responsibilities of the alternative jobs. 

        Please refer to [Ministry of Manpower's advisory](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information. 

    - title: Can I ask my employees to declare their vaccination status to me?
      content: |
        Employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for business purposes e.g. business continuity planning. While employers may adopt differentiated workplace measures for vaccinated and unvaccinated employees, they should not terminate or threaten to terminate the service of unvaccinated employees on the basis of their vaccination status alone.

        For the purpose of the VoRT regime, employees who decline or are unable to produce the proofs of vaccination will be regarded as unvaccinated and will be required to undergo twice-weekly testing until 31 December 2021.
