      content: |
        From 1 January 2022, more employees<sup>1</sup> are allowed to return to the workplace.

        i. Up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home can be at the workplace at any point in time. For example, a company with 100 employees who can work from home can have up to 50 of these employees at the workplace at any point in time.

        ii. Those who report to work onsite are encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).

        iii. As workplace requirements and business models vary, employers are best placed to decide on work arrangements to ensure operational effectiveness and sustainability in the long run. 

        From 15 January 2022 onwards (Phase 2), the pre-event testing (PET) concession for unvaccinated persons to go to work under the Workforce Vaccination Measures will be removed. A grace period until 31 January 2022 will be granted for partially vaccinated workers (i.e. those who have taken at least 1 dose of vaccine but not yet fully vaccinated) to complete their vaccination regime. During this grace period, they will continue to be able to enter the workplace with a negative PET result. 

        Employers and employees can refer to the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details on work arrangements for unvaccinated employees. 

        Special attention should be paid to vulnerable employees (e.g. older workers, pregnant workers, and those with underlying medical conditions) to enable them to work from home. For these employees, you could consider temporarily redeploying them to another role within the company so that they are able to telecommute or work from home.

      content: |
        F&B establishments are allowed to continue food service operations, with the exception of establishments with Pubs, Bars, Nightclubs, Discos and Karaoke SFA license categories or SSIC codes starting with 5613.

        Up to 5 persons are allowed to dine in together at F&B establishments, as long as they have met requirements for VDS. Unvaccinated children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010) may be included within the group of 5 persons as long as all the children are from the same household. Those born in 2009 will be allowed for now, but they will need to be fully vaccinated to dine in from 1 March 2022.

        Groups of up to 5 persons are allowed to dine in at hawker centres and coffee shops  where full VDS checks have been implemented. Otherwise, dining-in at hawker centres and coffee shops<sup>2</sup> without full VDS checks will remain at groups of up to 2 persons who are fully vaccinated. Strict enforcement action will be taken against coffeeshops that allow groups of up to 5 fully vaccinated persons to dine in without implementing the necessary checks as well as against individuals who breach this rule. 

        From 1 December 2021, those who are medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme (NVP)<sup>3</sup> are eligible for VDS settings and can be included within the group of 5 persons. 

        Customers can only dine in if they meet any of the following criteria:

        a.	Are fully vaccinated<sup>4</sup>; 

        b.	Have recovered from COVID-19<sup>5</sup>; or

        c.	Are children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in or after 2010<sup>6</sup>). If there are 2 or more such children in the group, the children must be from the same household.

        Dine-in is not allowed if any individual does not meet the eligibility criteria above. Allowing this would be an offence.

        <sup>2</sup> Coffee shops refer generally to F&B establishments with SFA coffee shop/ eating house/ canteen license <u>that are not substantially enclosed by a permanent barrier</u>.<br>
        <sup>3</sup> To be certified as medically ineligible for all COVID-19 vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, individuals may, from 15 November 2021, visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital to obtain a hardcopy doctor-certified memo.

      content: |
        Hard-copy and digital overseas vaccination certs are not recognised. 

        <b>All individuals aged 12 years and above</b> who have been fully vaccinated overseas with any vaccines approved under the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) needs to get their overseas vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). This includes Singaporean Citizens (SC), Singapore Permanent Residents (PR), Long-Term Pass Holder (LTPH) (e.g. Long-Term Visitor Pass, Work Permit, Employment Pass, S Pass, Dependent Pass, Student Pass) and Short-Term Pass Holders (STPH). For STPHs, this would only be relevant to those who intend to stay in Singapore for more than 30 days. You may call ahead to any clinic to check if they provide such services. You can also refer to [phpc.gov.sg](https://my-sgdcs.sgnet.gov.sg/personal/ESG-CY6678/Documents/phpc.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for a listing of clinics who may provide such services; please call ahead to check. The full cost of the service will be borne by the individual.

        If their overseas vaccination documents are not in English, they will need to get the documents translated by a translation service provider, notary public or embassy of the country that issued the document. Both the original overseas vaccination document and translated document must be brought along when visiting a private healthcare provider in Singapore for serology testing.

        After arriving in Singapore, the individual will need to visit a healthcare provider who will do the following:

        1.	Review the individual's overseas vaccination documentation - either the original hard copy vaccination certificate or digital vaccination certificate (with translated document where applicable).

        2.	Perform a serology test.

        3.	Update the individual's overseas COVID-19 vaccination record(s) to NIR as long as the individual (i) has overseas COVID-19 vaccination documentation, and (ii) whose serology test result is positive.
        
        4.	Individuals will see their vaccinations status on TraceTogether or HealthHub app within 24 hours after clinic has notified NIR of their overseas COVID-19 vaccination records.

    - title: Why are overseas vaccination certificates not recognised for VDS?
      content: |
        Overseas vaccine certificates (hard or softcopy) will not be accepted for VDS because it is difficult for individual establishments to verify the authenticity of these certificates which are issued in different formats and languages. 

    - title: How do I conduct VDS verification for foreign visitors?
      content: |
        All travellers, including those on VTL, will be required to download the TraceTogether app or rent a TraceTogether token during their stay in Singapore.

        Travellers who are vaccinated overseas would get their overseas vaccinated records reflected electronically on TraceTogether to show, on demand, to be eligible for VDS. Travellers would be granted temporary vaccinated status lasting 30 days or 180 days (only for travellers who uploaded their QR codes while applying for the VTP). This can be done through: 

        * Uploading their digitally-verifiable vaccination certificate in their SG Arrival Card; or 
        
        * Presenting their vaccination certificate to the ICA officer at manual immigration clearance. 

        To maintain the vaccination status beyond the temporary status, they will need to take a serology test at the following clinics (go.gov.sg/clinicsforserology) to have their vaccination records ingested into the National Immunisation Registry (NIR). Following this, their vaccination status will be reflected in the TraceTogether app or token within 24 hours.

All workers<sup>14</sup> in [malls, large standalone stores](/images/guides/FET Notice_Retail Malls and Large Standalone Stores 011021 Clean.pdf){:target="_blank"} and [supermarket outlets](/images/guides/FET Notice - Supermarkets (updated as of 19 Nov).pdf){:target="_blank"}, as well as those in [personal care services](/images/guides/Stringent FET Notice_PCS_301221_Final.pdf){:target="_blank"} (e.g. facial and nail services, spas/saunas, massage establishments, hairdressing, and make-up services) are to be tested once every 7 days (under Fast and Easy Test Rostered Routine Testing, or FET RRT) through employer-supervised self-swabs, regardless of vaccination status<sup>15</sup>. More details are available at [https://enterprisesg.gov.sg/sector-testing](https://enterprisesg.gov.sg/sector-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

        <sup>14</sup> This refers to all mall management workers as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops, business owners, store managers, all part-time and full-time workers, third-party contracted workers based in malls and all other workers who work at the premises, e.g. cleaners, promoters.<br>
        <sup>15</sup> Recovered individuals who are not vaccinated will no longer be exempted from the FET regime, even if they are within the first 270 days from the date of positive PCR. Only fully vaccinated individuals who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection can be exempted from the testing regime.

    - title: How can supermarket manage queues now that the measures may result in more people buying groceries to cook at home?
      content: |
        Supermarket retailers should implement other crowd management measures (e.g. limiting the number of shoppers within the store at any one time) to ensure that one metre spacing can be maintained between shoppers. They would also need to limit groups of customers entering the store to no more than 5 persons, as well as maintain orderly queues in-store, and at entrance to store.

        Supermarkets are also encouraged to provide dedicated shopping hours for vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, persons with disabilities and pregnant women. This can help to reduce intermingling to better protect those who are more vulnerable to COVID-19.

    - title: Are game arcades permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Yes, they can remain open. However, operators must practise safe management and safe distancing measures. They must ensure that common touchpoints are disinfected frequently.

    - title: Are playgrounds/ indoor playgrounds permitted to open? 
      content: |
        Common play areas for children/toddlers/infants in retail stores or malls can remain open. Operators of these play areas must ensure at least one-metre spacing between groups of customers.

    - title: Are personal care services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Personal care services that require the removal of masks are allowed to resume if customers are fully vaccinated. These include beauty services and/or activities offered at retail outlets.

        Examples of such services include facial treatments, saunas, makeup services and portions of threading and facial grooming services, which require customers' masks to be removed

    - title: Are massage/spa services permitted to continue operations?
      content: |
        Massage services are still allowed to operate within private rooms. However, customers will need to have their masks on at all times.

    - title: Are TCM patients allowed to take off their masks during their consultation?

    - title: Do I need to send my staff for regular testing?   
      content: |
        All employees who work at settings with unmasked clients/patron, or where there is prolonged contact between individuals, are required to be placed on a regular Fast and Easy Tests Rostered Routine Testing (FET RRT) regime using tests such as antigen rapid tests (ART), regardless of vaccination status. These include: 

        a. All workers<sup>16</sup> at F&B establishments that provide dine-in services, as well as all last-mile food delivery personnel; 
        
        b. All workers<sup>17</sup> in <u>malls, large standalone stores, supermarket outlets and personal care services</u> (e.g. nail services, massage establishments, hairdressing); 
        
        c. Gyms and fitness studios where clients are unmasked;

        The regular FET for staff in these settings is mandatory. The frequency of the FET is once every 7 days to facilitate the earlier detection of cases.

        <sup>16</sup> This refers to all workers who work under an enterprise's direction, including part-time and full-time workers, third-party contracted workers, and all other workers who work on the premises, e.g. cleaners, contractors, subcontractors.<br>
        <sup>17</sup> This refers to all mall management workers as well as all tenants and vendors who work in the malls, large standalone stores and supermarkets, including those working in office spaces of the shops, business owners, store managers, all part-time and full-time workers, third-party contracted workers based in malls and all other workers who work at the premises, e.g. cleaners, promoters.

    - title: Why do I need to send my staff for regular testing?   
      content: |
        Identified settings are of higher risks, as clients/patrons are unmasked or where there is prolonged contact between individuals. Employees who work at these settings would therefore need to undergo a 7-day regular FET.

    - title: I understand that the FET regime is mandatory from 15 July. I have received my ART test kits but am experiencing technical issues with the Swab Registration System (SRS) (e.g. unable to log into the system/ upload supervisors/ upload results). What should I do? Can I still continue to operate?
      content: |
        You can continue to operate. However, you should reach out to HPB's SRS technical support at [AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg](mailto:AskSRS@hpb.gov.sg) or [6876 5830](tel:+6568765830) if you are facing technical issues with the SRS. Once you have received your ART test kits, you should proceed with the testing of your staff and keep a record of the results. Once the SRS system issues have been resolved, you will need to upload these backdated results into the system. 

    - title: I own a small business and am unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on my own. What should I do?
      content: |
        We encourage all businesses with at least 2 staff to conduct employer supervised self-swabs for their employees. 

        However, for small businesses (e.g. hawkers or establishments with only 1 employee) who are unable to organise the supervised self-swabs on their own, the government will set up Quick Test Centres (QTCs) to support those who need to be tested. 

        F&B businesses can refer to SFA's guide for onboarding for testing at Quick Test Centres (QTCs) ([https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments](https://www.sfa.gov.sg/covid-19/mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing-(fet)-regime-for-all-outlet-employees-at-dine-in-f-b-establishments){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}). Please refer to the section on "How to onboard by Quick Test Centre?” on the steps required.

        For small businesses in retail malls (e.g., pushcarts or sole proprietors) with only 1 employee who are unable to organize the supervised self-swabs on their own, please ask your mall management team if they can assist with onboarding you as part of their weekly test. For this arrangement, your weekly ART result will be submitted under the UEN of the mall management team. Alternatively, similar small businesses in retail malls may group together and nominate one UEN which the results will be uploaded. Such businesses may also appoint trusted non-staff persons to supervise the self-swabs and submit the results.

    - title: Can supervision be done virtually?   
      content: |
        Yes, supervision of employee's self-swab can be done virtually as alternatives to on-site supervision. Possible alternative approaches include a) virtual-live supervision or b) post-swab video supervision. 

        a) Virtual-live supervision involves real-time supervision of the swabbing process through virtual platforms. Employees can annotate the details (name and timestamp) on the test kit and perform the self-swab. Employees can exit the virtual platform after the swab is done and submit a photo of the kit result to the supervisor thereafter. 

        b) Post-swab video supervision involves employees taking a video of themselves self-swabbing and submitting the recorded video alongside a photo of the test kit result. Both the photo and the video should have a timestamp and employers should check all the videos submitted.

    - title: I am a big establishment with a lot of outlets and employees. Will there be an alternative to self-collecting the kits?
      content: |
        To facilitate the collection/delivery of test kits, F&B establishments should submit full details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} as soon as possible. Establishments must consolidate the collection/delivery of kits to a single location for each UEN. Depending on the size of your workforce, the kits may be arranged as a delivery to your address instead.

    - title: I have run out of test kits and have not received a replenishment delivery. Can I request for more test kits?
      content: |
        Replenishment of test kits is based on kit utilisation, tracked through the submission of completed test results on the Swab Registration System (SRS). HPB monitors companies’ utilisation and will automatically schedule a replenishment when kits are used up.

        Companies are reminded to test employees regularly and submit all FET results on the SRS. Government funded test kits must only be used for the FET RRT and additional kits used for purposes outside of the FET regime must be procured by companies themselves.

    - title: How do I create an account on SRS to upload the employees' swab test results?
      content: |
        For unregistered F&B establishments, please submit your details at [https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food](https://go.gov.sg/fet-registration-food){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This registration would facilitate the set-up of companies' SRS accounts and arrange for the delivery or collection of ART kits.

        Enterprises with multiple outlets must consolidate their submission and submit a single Order Form for each UEN. Enterprises will be responsible for the dissemination of the test kits to their respective outlets.  The Point-of-Contact<sup>18</sup> (POC) indicated in the form must be the employee who will be responsible for both self-collection/delivery of the test kits, and the uploading of FET results to the SRS account.

        After the creation of the SRS account, the POC will need to upload the particulars of their supervisors. With the successful upload of their particulars, supervisors will be able to submit test results through the unique company SRS link.

        <sup>18</sup> Establishments are also able to nominate an alternate POC, if they wish to do so.

    - title: How do I add entries for new supervisors/update supervisors' details on the SRS?
      content: |
        Once the company's SRS account has been created, the POC may log into the account to upload supervisors' details, as well as make edits subsequently. The upload of supervisors' details would give them access to submit test results through the unique company SRS link. 

    - title: Is there a deadline for employers to key in the test results onto the SRS portal?
      content: |
        Establishments are required to upload the results of the outlet workers' swab tests to the SRS on the same day as the tests are taken (within 24 hours). 

        For Ag+ cases, the results must be submitted on the SRS within 12 hours from the time of the test.
