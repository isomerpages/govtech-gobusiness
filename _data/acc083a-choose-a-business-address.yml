      Companies and Limited Liability Partnerships (LLP) must provide a business address (known as a registered office address) when applying to incorporate a company. A registered office address is where all communications and notices to the company/LLP are addressed to. 

      All companies and LLPs must ensure that their registered office is open and accessible to the public for not less than three hours during ordinary business hours on each business day. This is to enable the public, businesses, stakeholders and government agencies to visit the company/LLPâ€™s office or communicate via correspondence with the company/LLP.

      The registered office address must be an address in Singapore but need not be the place of operations of the company/LLP (e.g. the registered office address may be in Raffles Place but the factory could be located in Tuas).
