      Audited financial statements refer to both the balance sheet and the profit and loss statement.

      If your company's financial statements have not been audited, you can provide unaudited financial statements or management accounts.

      If your company is new and you don't have a full year's financial statements, you may provide a to-date unaudited financial statement or management account. The agency processing your application will assess these.
