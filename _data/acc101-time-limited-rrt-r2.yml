    - title: Why is MOH conducting a second round of ART kit distribution to workplaces?
      content: |
        With more employees returning to the workplace from 1 Jan 2022, there could be higher risk of workplace transmission, particularly given the higher transmissibility of the Omicron variant. Regular testing is therefore important to ensure early detection and ringfencing of cases at the workplace. To support this practice, the Government is undertaking a second round of ART kit distribution which eligible companies can apply for. Applications have closed on 31 Jan 2022.

    - title: My company has missed the application deadline. Can we still apply?
      content: |
        The application period is from 3 Jan to 31 Jan 2022, and applications have closed. Companies will not be able to apply after the application period.

    - title: If employees are working on a split-team arrangement and returning to office on alternate days or weeks, are they eligible for the kits? 
      content: |
        Companies may apply for staff who are returning to office on alternate days or weeks so long as they are fully vaccinated and not already under the mandatory RRT regime. These staff should continue to self-test on weeks when they are working from home over the 2-month period.  

    - title: I have already applied for the second round of kits distribution, but my company is still working from home. Do I need to return the kits?
      content: |
        You do not have to return the kits but your company will need to submit results twice over the next 8 weeks from the time of receipt of kits (i.e. once at the end of each month's testing cycle), to indicate how many employees have been tested, and explain the shortfall if need be.

        Upon return to office, you will need to commence testing and continue submitting results on a monthly basis until testing is complete.

    - title: I started my weekly voluntary testing regime, but have an employee who tested positive at a GP in the first week, and was subsequently given the 'recovered' status which exempts him from Pre-Event Testing. Will he also be exempted from the Time-Limited RRT when he comes back to work?
      content: |
        The employee may still use the test kits for weekly testing when he returns to the workplace. Companies may use the test kits for testing of onsite employees who are fully vaccinated (including those who have recovered), those certified to be medically ineligible, or unvaccinated and recovered from COVID-19 infection within 180 days. 

    - title: I have already submitted an application but realised that I have missed adding some new hires and part-timers. Can I submit another application?
      content: |
        There can only be ONE (1) application submitted per company UEN. Applications for Round 2 of the kits distribution have also closed. Should additional kits be required after the first application, these should be purchased at your company's own costs. 

    - title: Can I cancel my application after submitting? 
      content: |
        Applications that have already been submitted cannot be cancelled, and ART kits that have already been delivered cannot be returned. Companies are expected to commence weekly testing for their eligible employees upon receipt of the kits.

    - title: My company has submitted the application. When will my company receive the ART kits?
      content: |
        Successful applicants will be informed of their delivery up to 10 working days from the time of complete application. However, for completed applications sent in after 21 Jan onwards, please expect a longer processing and delivery lead time. . For enquiries regarding delivery, you may send in an enquiry via this [form](https://go.gov.sg/tlrrt-round-2-delivery-enquiry){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: How will the kits be delivered to my company?
      content: |
        To ensure that ART kits can be distributed to companies in a timely manner, we will only provide a one-time delivery to ONE (1) location per company UEN. If there are multiple offices/outlets registered under the same company UEN, your company should make your own arrangements to re-distribute the kits to other locations at your own cost.

        Companies will receive a pre-delivery notification via SMS/email and should ensure that there is someone present to receive the delivery. In the event of any failed delivery, the costs of re-delivery will be charged to the receiving company.

    - title: I have not received the kits even after 10 working days. What can I do?
      content: |
        For questions or issues regarding delivery, you may send in an enquiry via this [link](https://go.gov.sg/tlrrt-round-2-delivery-enquiry){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. We will contact you as soon as possible to resolve your enquiry.

    - title: I was contacted by the delivery vendor on the date of delivery, but I will not be around to receive the kits. Is there a way for me to reschedule the date of delivery? 
      content: |
        For questions or issues regarding delivery, you may send in an enquiry via this [link](https://go.gov.sg/tlrrt-round-2-delivery-enquiry){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. We will contact you as soon as possible to resolve your enquiry.

    - title: Can my company exchange the ART kits that we received for another brand? 
      content: |
        No, we do not allow any exchanges for the kits that were issued.

    - title: Does my company have to submit my employees' test results to the government?
      content: |
        Companies are required to declare the total number of employees tested, along with the number of Ag+ results recorded, in the ART results declaration form at the end of each month's testing cycle (i.e. twice across the two-month period) to the Government. The results declaration may be submitted via this link: [https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions](https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

        The detailed results of each individual employee do not need to be submitted to the Government. However, companies are expected to retain records of the test results till 30 Apr 2022, and to produce these as proof if audited by the government.

    - title: The MTF announced that from 18 Feb onwards, most sectors on mandatory Rostered Routine Testing (RRT) will not need to continue testing their employees. Does this also mean that my company can stop weekly testing from 18 Feb too?  
      content: |
        The mandatory RRT regime was implemented for higher-risk workplaces and is different from this time-limited 8-weeks kits distribution exercise. Therefore, the stepdown of mandatory RRT for higher-risk workplaces (except sectors interacting with vulnerable population and essential services) as announced in the 16 Feb MTF Press Release does not apply to this time-limited 8-weeks weekly testing at workplaces. Companies who applied and received kits under this Round 2 of time-limited kits distribution should continue weekly testing of eligible employees and report their test results to the Government until all the test kits received are fully utilised.

    - title: What processes should my company have in place to ensure that we are compliant?
      content: |
        Companies should have processes in place to ensure that the weekly tests are conducted properly, test results are recorded, and appropriate follow-up actions are adhered to. 

        If audited by the government, companies should be able to produce proof (e.g. email records, circulars, excel documents etc.) that such processes have been put in place and implemented. 

        |-|-|
        | Checklist of Processes | Suggested Practices|
        | Tests are properly conducted every week | * Provide employees with links to the self-test instructions and self-help materials.<br>* Request that employees submit photos of their used test kits displaying the results.<br>* Remind employees to conduct their weekly testing on a timely basis e.g. via email, messaging etc. |
        | Test results are recorded and submitted | * Provide a mode for employees to report their results e.g. via email, excel, HR portal etc.<br>* Verify that their employees have submitted their test results. |
        | Appropriate actions are taken if tested ART positive | * Share with employees on follow ups if tested ART positive. (refer to the subsequent FAQs below on what to do when tested ART positive) <br>Ensure that employees have adhered to the required follow-up actions. |

    - title: What actions will be taken if my company is found to be non-compliant?
      content: |
        The Government shall have the right to claw back the cost of any test kits should there be any late submission of results or required information, or if any of the information submitted in the application form or results declaration form is untrue, or if non-compliance to the testing requirements is found.

    - title: My company participated in the first round of kits distribution in Sep/Oct, but commenced weekly testing late as we had pivoted to work-from-home arrangements. We wish to submit the test results for the kits received in Sep/Oct 2021, but am unable to access the results declaration link for the first round of kits distribution. What should I do? 
      content: |
        Companies who wish to submit the test results under Round 1 of Time-Limited RRT (Sep/Oct 2021) may do so via the results link provided for Round 2 of Time-Limited RRT ([https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions](https://go.gov.sg/round-2-tlrrt-results-submissions){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}), and indicate “Submission for Round 1” under the Remarks column.

    - title: My company participated in the first round of kits distribution in Sep/Oct, but commenced weekly testing late as we had pivoted to work-from-home arrangements. How long do we need to retain proof of processes and test results for?
      content: |
        For companies who would still be conducting testing beyond 31 January 2022 due to various reasons, please retain all necessary proof/results for a duration of one month after the second round of results declaration. E.g. if testing ends on 15 February 2022, please retain the necessary proof/results until 15 March 2022.

        You may refer to this [link](https://go.gov.sg/sd-biosensor){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for self-test instructions for the SD Biosensor kits which you have received.  

        You may also follow the step-by-step instructions available [here](https://artbuddy.healthpixel.co/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or obtain more information from go.gov.sg/selftestart. 

    - title: Is ART painful?
      content: |
        ART is conducted by inserting a swab stick approximately 2cm into the nostril. These swabs are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. Users may experience some discomfort, but the swabs should not be painful.

    - title: Is frequent ART swabbing harmful to me?
      content: |
        Frequent swabbing has not been proven to be harmful. ART swabs are inserted at around 2cm into the nostril, which are shallower and less intrusive than the nasopharyngeal swabs taken for PCR tests. However, if you have had recent facial surgery or frequent nose bleeds, you are advised to visit a [licensed ART provider](https://www.moh.gov.sg/docs/librariesprovider5/covid19_test_providers/approved-covid-19-art-swab-provider-(caa-18-june).pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to have a professional perform the ART for you.

    - title: If I am feeling unwell on the day of testing (i.e. have sore throat, cough or fever), should I still proceed to do the test?
      content: |
        If you are experiencing acute respiratory symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, flu or runny nose), you may visit a primary care provider who will assess your condition and administer the relevant tests.

    - title: What do my results mean?
      content: |
        Negative: Even if you test negative, please stay vigilant. Do continue to observe safe distancing measures and practice good personal hygiene such as regular handwashing and wearing a mask when leaving your home. Continue to monitor your health and test yourself where necessary.

        Positive: If you are well and do not have symptoms, please isolate yourself and re-test yourself with further ART tests after 72 hours from the initial positive test. You may resume normal activities if you test negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and repeat antigen rapid tests at least one day apart. You can stop self-isolation and resume daily activities when it tests negative. If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat at any point in time, please visit a primary care doctor for further assessment. 

        Invalid: An invalid test may mean that the test was not performed correctly, or the test kit was faulty. You should re-read the instructions on how to perform the test and repeat an ART with a new test kit until you get a valid ART result. You may also consider undergoing a self-paid ART which is supervised or done by a healthcare provider, such as at Quick Test Centres or medical clinics. 

    - title: What should I do if I experience nose bleeding after swabbing?
      content: |
        Please consult a doctor if you experience persistent nose bleeding.

    - title: How should I dispose the used test kit?
      content: |
        After reading the results, please take a photo with your ID in the same photo if the result is positive or both results are invalid.

        To dispose the test kit, place all the used items from the test kit into a plastic bag or a sealable bag and seal it. Place the sealed bag into another plastic bag. Tie the second plastic bag with a rubber band or cable tie. Please ensure that the bags are tightly tied to protect your community. Throw it into the rubbish chute or a pedal bin immediately.

    - title: What should I do if I test ART positive?
      content: |
        You should isolate yourself at home if you are well and test positive. 

        After 72 hours, repeat an ART. You can resume daily activities if it tests negative. If it is positive, continue to self-isolate and self-test daily until you obtain a negative result OR until 12pm on Day 7 (for fully vaccinated individuals) or Day 14 (for non-fully vaccinated individuals aged 12 years and above), whichever comes earlier.

        If you feel unwell e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, please visit a primary care provider to be assessed medically.

    - title: What should I do as part of self-isolation?
      content: |
        You should take steps and make arrangements to make sure that you can isolate yourself from other persons in your household. You should minimise interactions with other household members, and practise good hygiene habits. These include:
        
        * Staying in a room on your own as much as possible and keeping the door closed
        
        * If you have to share a bathroom, clean it each time you use it by wiping surfaces
        
        * Wash your hands often
        
        * Keep the windows open to ensure the house is well-ventilated

        You are advised not to leave home unless to seek medical care for COVID-19.

    - title: What should I do if I do not have an ART test to do the repeat tests?
      content: |
        You may use the ART kits that your company has applied for you to conduct the repeat tests. If that is not available or accessible, your family and friends can help to purchase or you can purchase them online.

    - title: If I test ART positive, when should I proceed to receive a confirmatory PCR test instead of self-isolating? 
      content: |
        You are not required to receive a confirmatory PCR test unless your primary care provider advises you to do so. 

    - title: What should my household members, colleagues or close contacts do if I am ART positive?
      content: |
        If you test ART positive during your visit to a primary care provider where you received a healthcare-administered ART, Health Risk Warnings (HRW) will be issued to your close contacts, including those identified through the TraceTogether app and self-declaration of household members. Persons issued with HRW should follow the prevailing Protocol 3. 

        If you had tested ART positive via a self-administered ART. Your close contacts will not be issued a HRW. However, we advise that they take the following precautions:
        
        * <b>Minimise contact with the person who had tested ART positive</b>
        
        * <b>Take an ART self-test within 24 hours of their last contact with the person</b>
        
        * <b>Should they need to leave home over the next 7 days, e.g. to work or to school, take an ART self-test on the same day</b>
        
          1. <b>If negative, they may leave home</b>

          2. <b>If positive, follow the instructions for persons tested ART positive.</b>

        During the 7-day period, avoid unnecessary interactions with others as much as possible. 

    - title: My employee has tested ART positive, can I require that he/she undergoes a confirmatory PCR test?
      content: |
        Companies should not require employees to undergo a confirmatory PCR test unless the employee visits a primary care doctor who advises him/her to do so. 

    - title: My employee has tested ART negative after having tested positive initially. Is it safe for him/her to return to work?
      content: |
        As long as a person without symptoms has tested negative on the antigen test that was done at least 72 hours after the initial positive test, the person can return to work safely. 

        There is no need for PCR testing before the person returns to work.
