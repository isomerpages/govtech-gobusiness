    - title: Are staycations allowed? 
      content: |

    - title: What is the Business Travel Pass?
      content: |
        One of Singapore's key value propositions is our position as an air and business hub. This includes the ease with which executives based in Singapore can travel around the region for work, to oversee regional operations.

        Unfortunately, the ease of travel has been severely affected by restrictions to safeguard against COVID-19. SME owners cannot visit their customers and factories in the region, and MNCs with global/regional HQ functions here are unable to operate fully. We need to enable these businesspersons to travel more easily, and safely, or risk losing these business functions to other countries.

        Hence, the Business Travel Pass is meant for senior executives in Singapore with regional or international roles who need to travel regularly for business. We are doing this in a gradual and calibrated manner to manage our public health situation carefully.

        -	All travellers on this scheme are required to be fully vaccinated with a recognised vaccine under the HSA-PSAR and WHO-EUL lists. 
        
        -	Travellers with the Business Travel Pass will be required to abide by a strict controlled itinerary when they travel overseas for work. 
        
        -	Before returning to Singapore, they are required to make a health declaration to ensure that they do not have any symptoms and have not encountered anyone infected with COVID-19. 
        
        -	All travellers will be required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test/professionally administered ART (for Cat l to IV countries only) taken within 2 days before departure, before they can travel to Singapore.
        
        -	Upon return, travellers will undergo an on-arrival COVID-19 Supervised Self-Swab (SSS) ART within 24 hours of arrival (for Cat I to IV countries) in lieu of the Stay-Home Notice (SHN).

        These testing requirements serve to minimise the risk of potential incubating cases leaking into the community. 

    - title: Where can the senior executives travel to with the Business Travel Pass?
      content: |
        The Business Travel Pass is not country specific and senior executives will be able to travel to a range of countries, subject to the countries' border requirements. 

        Although the Business Travel Pass is not a ‘free-pass' for travellers to enter various countries, it facilitates the Business Travel Pass holders' return to Singapore, to carry on with their business operations, subject to prevailing border restrictions in Singapore for pass holders. 

        Travellers must abide by both the destination's public health rules, as well as the stringent health protocols in Singapore upon their return. 

        If they are found not to have abided by any of the protocols, their passes may be revoked.

    - title: What are the eligibility criteria for this travel pass?
      content: |
        The Business Travel Pass is issued to senior executives in Singapore with international or regional responsibilities who travel regularly for official and business purposes. 

        *	Approval is given only if we are assured that the individual will comply with the stringent public health requirements and safeguards.

        *	We will maintain the ability to revoke the Business Travel Pass if we find that the traveller failed to abide by the stringent health protocols.  

        Eligible candidates include senior executives of all nationalities in Singapore. Foreign nationals are required to hold an Employment Pass (EP), EntrePass, Personalised Employment Pass (PEP) or Immigration Exemption Order (IEO). 

        * Only travellers sponsored by government agencies may submit applications for a Business Travel Pass through their respective sponsoring government agencies or sector leads.

        Travellers on this scheme must be fully vaccinated with a recognised vaccine under the HSA-PSAR and WHO-EUL lists. 

    - title: Why must applications for the Business Travel Pass be sponsored by government agencies?
      content: |
        Travellers are required to keep close contact with their sponsoring government agencies which allows us to follow up closely with these travellers to determine the public health outcome of the scheme.

        Through the government agencies, we will also be able to contact these travellers quickly in the event that we need to adjust parameters of the Business Travel Pass in response to a sudden change in the global epidemiological situation. The travellers will have to immediately adapt to and abide by any change in public health requirements. 

        This is critical because public health remains our number one priority as we explore new ways to resume business travel to aid in our economic recovery.

    - title: How can embassies/chambers work with MTI to obtain Business Travel Passes for diplomats/affiliated companies?
      content: |
        There is a tight limit on the number of Business Travel Passes available. Our focus is on monitoring the implementation of the pilot to ensure that public health risk can be managed. This will enable us to assess whether to expand the initiative. 

        Regional travel for businesses based in Singapore is important. We want to enable this as much as possible in a safe and sustainable manner, while protecting the health of these travellers and the local community.

        In the meantime, companies may also wish to consider utilising other available travel lanes for entry into Singapore from applicable countries for business purposes.

    - title: When will the Business Travel Pass be open for public application?
      content: |
        We do not have a fixed timeline for this scheme and are taking a step-by-step approach in our evaluation of the scheme. Our number one priority for now is public health and we want to carefully monitor the progress of this pilot before making any decisions.

    - title: How many Business Travel Passes are available?
      content: |
        Because public health remains our priority, we will limit the number of Business Travel Passes and carefully monitor the public health outcomes in this phase.

    - title: What are the health protocols and safeguards for this travel pass?
      content: |
        Travellers will be required to submit a controlled itinerary of their meetings and activities while abroad, including the contacts they meet and venues they go to, and must adhere strictly to this controlled itinerary. Travellers who leave Singapore without an approved controlled itinerary, will be subject to the prevailing border measures for non-BTP holders upon their return to Singapore which may include an SHN at SHN Dedicated Facilities (SDF).
 
        Before returning to Singapore, they are required to make a health declaration to ensure that they do not have any symptoms and have not encountered anyone infected with COVID-19. 

        All travellers will be required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test/professionally administered ART (for Cat l to IV countries) taken within 2 days before departure, before they can travel to Singapore. 

        Upon arriving in Singapore, they will take an on-arrival Supervised Self-Swab (SSS) ART within 24 hours of arrival (for Cat I to IV countries). 

        On top of that, travellers are required to use TraceTogether, comply with safe management measures at their workplace and for events and abide by all other prevailing measures applicable to local residents. 

        If travellers are found to have breached any of the health protocols stated above, their Business Travel Pass may be revoked and they may face further penalties. 


    - title: Why are we allowing travellers to come into Singapore without serving SHN?
      content: |
        Travellers will be required to comply with stringent public health requirements and additional safeguards. For instance, they are required to submit a controlled itinerary before leaving Singapore and adhere strictly to this itinerary abroad. All travellers will be required to present a negative COVID-19 PCR test/professionally administered ART (for Cat l to IV countries) taken within 2 days before departure, before they can travel to Singapore. 

        Upon their arrival in Singapore, travellers are required to undergo an on-arrival  Supervised Self-Swab (SSS) ART within 24 hours of arrival (for Cat I to IV countries) in lieu of their SHN requirements. These serve as a precautionary measure to capture any possible incubating cases.    

        In order to limit the potential public health risks, we are starting only with a small number of Business Travel Passes. 

        We will continue to carefully monitor the global situation and the public health outcomes of this scheme in order to strike a calibrated balance between the safety of the local community and resuming business travel in support of our overall economic recovery.
