    - title: What are the latest requirements for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions?
      content: |
        The updated safe management measures (SMMs) for marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions are as follows:  

        ||**From 1 February 2022 onwards**|
        |**Marriage Solemnizations**||
        |Home|Up to 10 attendees or 5 visitors (whichever is higher)<br>Vaccination-Differentiated SMMs (VDS) requirement<sup>1</sup>|
        |ROM/M Building|Up to 10 attendees, with VDS requirement<sup>1</sup>|
        |External venues| - Up to 1,000 attendees, with VDS requirement<sup>1</sup>;<br> - Group size of up to 5 attendees|
        |**Wedding Receptions**||
        |Home and ROM/M Building|Not allowed|
        |External venues (Excluding Places of Worship)| - Up to 250 attendees, with VDS requirement<sup>1</sup><br> - Group size of up to 5 attendees|

        These limits include the couple, but exclude the Licensed Solemnizer and any other vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the wedding event. The couples and all attendees (including the Licensed Solemnizer and vendors) will have to abide by VDS entry requirements.

        Children aged 12 years and below (i.e. born in and after 2010<sup>2</sup>), who are seated within the groups of 5 attendees or who are part of the wedding party must be from the same household.

        All marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions continue to be subject to the prevailing safe management measures, such as zonal/time slot requirements and safe distancing rules, and prevailing group size of up to 5 people. Please refer to the requirements [here](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/). All wedding guests must strictly abide by the safe management measures, and in particular, maintain social distancing and avoid mingling with others beyond their own table. 

        Organisers must ensure that before entering the event, all attendees must check in to the event using TraceTogether-only SafeEntry. TraceTogether, the SEBizApp or HealthHub can be used to check the vaccination status of attendees.  The venue owner/operator<sup>3</sup> or organisers should have a unique QR code for the event space, e.g. hotel ballroom or private room in a restaurant.

        For home solemnizations, organisers are required to remind all attendees at least one hour before the start of the event that VDS applies to the event.

        For more information on SafeEntry, please refer to the link [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/safeentry/).

        For more information on VDS, please refer to MOH’s advisory at [https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo](https://go.gov.sg/vdsmminfo){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}

        <sup>1</sup> Where VDS is required, it means that checks must be implemented to ensure that every attendee <br>
        a) is fully vaccinated i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective, and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH's national IT systems.From 14 February 2022, persons aged 18 years old and above who have completed the primary vaccination series and are eligible for booster vaccination will be considered as fully vaccinated for 270 days after the last dose in their primary vaccination series. Upon receiving their booster, they will continue to be considered as fully vaccinated beyond the 270 days. The same will apply to persons aged 12 to 17 years old from 14 March 2022; or<br>
        b) has recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore with unvaccinated or incomplete vaccination status within 180 days starting from the day of first local (i) positive Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test result, or (ii) positive healthcare-administered Antigen Rapid Test (ART) result for symptomatic persons, (iii) positive serology test result attributable to infection and not past vaccination; or<br>
        c) is a child aged 12 years or below; or<br>
        d) is certified as medically ineligible for all vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme (NVP). To be certified as medically ineligible, individuals may visit a doctor familiar with their medical condition, or alternatively, any clinic or hospital.

        <sup>2</sup> A grace period (1 January to 28 February 2022) has been extended to children born in December 2009 to allow them sufficient time to get fully vaccinated (please refer to the [MOH Press Release on 2 December 2021](https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/reminder-to-complete-primary-series-of-sinovac-coronavac-and-sinopharm-vaccines_2Dec2021){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more details).

        <sup>3</sup> Venue operator refers to the party that has charge, management or control of the room or place where the event takes place, during the period of the event.

    - title: Why are measures changed so often?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) has been closely monitoring the local and global COVID-19 situation, and will continue to review the safe management measures and community related activities. However, should there be further tightening, couples should be prepared to adjust their plans accordingly.

    - title: What are the safe management measures that we must follow?
      content: |
        Please refer to sector-specific requirements for marriage solemnizations [here](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

    - title: Are vendors (e.g. photographers, videographers) part of the attendee limit?
      content: |
        Vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the marriage solemnization or wedding reception are excluded from the attendance limit for these events but should be kept to a minimum. (Vendors who are also invited guests are part of the attendee limit).

    - title: Can the bride and groom remove face masks for the solemnization ceremony or wedding reception? Can the bride and groom use face shields in place of face masks? Can the rest of the attendees be unmasked for photo-taking?
      content: |
        As a special provision, the bride and groom may be unmasked throughout the marriage solemnization (excluding ROM/M Building) or wedding reception event. To enjoy the unmasking provision, the wedding couple is required to (i) undergo an Antigen Rapid Test (ART) minimally supervised by the venue operator<sup>3</sup> (either in person or virtually); or (ii) have a valid PET within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. The bride and groom must maintain a 2-metre distance from the rest of the attendees of the marriage solemnization or wedding reception(with the exception of wedding party) whenever masks and face shields are removed.

        Should the bride and groom opt not to undergo the ART or PET, they may remove their face shields or mask for key moments only (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs) and maintain a safe distance of at least 2 metres from others at such times.

        All other attendees must wear their masks throughout the solemnization process or wedding reception<sup>4</sup> , but masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking and must be worn immediately after.

        On the use of masks and face shield, please refer to the latest guidelines [here](https:/www.moh.gov.sg/news-highlights/details/guidance-for-use-of-masks-and-face-shields){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        <sup>3</sup> Venue operator refers to the party that has charge, management or control of the room or place where the event takes place, during the period of the event.
        <sup>4</sup> Children aged twelve years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time, may wear a face shield as indicated in MOH's Advisory of 1 Jun 2020 (“Guidance for Use of Masks and Face Shields”)
    - title: As a wedding couple, I would like to be unmasked for my solemnization / reception, but my venue operator is not available to supervise my ART. What can I do?
      content: |
        If you are unable to do an ART minimally supervised by the venue operator (either in person or virtually), you can opt to have a valid PET obtained within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. Otherwise, the wedding couples can choose to wear a face shield instead of a face mask, and to remove the face shield for the key moments (e.g. when exchanging vows for rings, kiss, march-in/outs). 

    - title: Can I have more than 10 different guests remove their masks when giving speech at different timings during my marriage solemnization and/or wedding reception?
      content: |
        At any time during the marriage solemnization in external venues (i.e. in venues excluding place of residence and the ROM/M building) and wedding reception, there should be no more than 10 unmasked individuals engaged in public speaking. For example, you can have up to 6 guests giving speech at timing A and another 6 guests at timing B. During the speech, the unmasked individuals must maintain a distance of at least 2 metres from the audience and least 1 metre from each other unless the individuals are members of the wedding party.

    - title: How long can our solemnization ceremony last?
      content: |
        For the safety of all attendees, the solemnization should be kept as brief as possible.

    - title: Are pre-wedding photo shoots allowed to take place? Can face masks/ shields be removed for pre-wedding photo shoots?
      content: |
        Pre-wedding photo shoots must adhere to IMDA's Mandatory Safety Rules for the Resumption of Content Production. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the Safe Management Measures that must be adhered to.

    - title: What are the guidelines for the attendance limit of home solemnizations, if I have more than 10 residents in my household?
      content: |
        For marriage solemnizations held in a place of residence, the maximum number of attendees for the home solemnization must not exceed 10 attendees or 5 visitors (whichever is higher). This limit includes the couple, but excludes the Licensed Solemnizer and vendors engaged to provide authorised services for the solemnization. Please note that from 1 February 2022, VDS requirement will be implemented for home solemnizations. 

        For example, if there are 6 attendees currently living in your household, the 6 residents and an additional 5 visitors can attend a solemnization in your home. The total of 11 attendees counts the wedding couple but excludes the Solemnizer and vendors. Or if you live alone, you and 9 other attendees, including the wedding couple, can attend a solemnization in your home, excluding the Solemnizer and vendors.

        If the place of residence has more than 10 residents, organisers should ensure that residents who are not attendees of the home solemnization do not physically interact or intermingle with the attendees at the solemnization.

        If a place of residence has 5 or more visitors attending a home solemnization (as guests or vendors), then the individual must not accept any more visitors that day to his or her place of residence.

        For the safety of all who are attending your home solemnization, please ensure that you and your guests comply with the following measures:

        - The bride and groom may be unmasked throughout the home solemnization. The wedding couples are required to (i) undergo an ART minimally supervised by the venue operator (either in person or virtually); or (ii) have a valid PET within 24 hours prior to the end of the event. The bride and groom may opt out from the ART or PET and remove their face shields/masks for key moments such as to exchange vows, rings, to kiss and during march-ins/ outs. Other guests must maintain a 2-metre distance from the bride and groom when they are unmasked. 

        - All guests must wear masks for the duration of the solemnization. They may remove their masks momentarily for photo-taking and must wear their masks immediately after the photos are taken.

    - title: Can I provide takeaway food after the solemnization ceremony?
      content: |
        No food or drinks are to be supplied or consumed in the room or place during a solemnization event. Takeaway food may be provided only after the solemnization ceremony is over, and must not be consumed at the solemnization venue. Once the solemnization ceremony is over, social gatherings cannot exceed 5 individuals and organisers of a solemnization should ensure that guests do not crowd around or outside the event venue to consume their takeaway food.

        Organisers of a solemnization must ensure that requirements for solemnization events are not breached. Rather than providing food for takeaway, you may wish to consider providing other tokens of appreciation such as vouchers or non-food gifts.

        If there is a queue for distributing the takeaway food, the enterprise providing the takeaway must ensure that there is at least 1m safe distancing between individuals in the queue.

    - title: Can I have children as part of my marriage solemnization or wedding reception?
      content: |
        If the wedding reception  or marriage solemnization includes children aged 12 years and below, these children who are seated within the groups of 5 attendees must be from the same household.

    - title: Can I have children to be part of the “wedding party” for my wedding reception?
      content: |
        Children aged 12 years and below who are from the same household, may be included in the wedding party.

    - title: If we opt for solemnization via video link, what is the limit to the number of guests in the same venue? Can the bride, groom, witnesses and guests be in the same venue?
      content: |
        For solemnizations via video-link, the prevailing home visit guidelines should be adhered to (i.e. up to 5 visitors to a home per day). The bride, groom, witnesses, and guests can be in the same location if they belong to the same household or if they are within the prevailing home visit guidelines (i.e. up to 5 visitors to a home per day). Other guests exceeding the 5 visitors allowed may wish to join in through video-link instead. Such processes through video-link ensures marriage solemnizations take place in a safe manner.

    - title: What are the attendance caps if I hold my solemnization immediately followed by a wedding reception?
      content: |
        From 1 February 2022, solemnizations are capped at 1,000 attendees with VDS requirement; that is, all solemnization events, irrespective of event size, must implement VDS in order to proceed. 

        Attendee limits include the bride and groom, and exclude the Solemnizer and vendors.

        -	If the wedding reception is held in the same room or space as the solemnization without any break in between, the entire event will be considered a wedding reception and be subject to the wedding reception safe management measures including attendance limits, i.e. up to 250 attendees (with VDS requirement). Attendee limits include the bride and groom, and exclude the Solemnizer and vendors.
        -	If organisers intend to hold separate solemnization and wedding reception events at the same venue, you are advised to have a reasonably long break between the two events. This will provide time to vacate and sanitise the venue after the first event and will also prevent interactions between the two sets of guests who are leaving or entering the venue.

    - title: Can I perform other cultural rites such as the tea ceremony during the reception?
      content: |
        Yes you may, subject to the safe management measures for receptions (e.g. no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests). For example, the tea ceremony can be held amongst the “wedding party” of up to 20 attendees as part of the reception, and must take into account the safe management measures for wedding receptions.

    - title: Can we have our tea ceremony at the solemnization venue?
      content: |
        Food and drinks are not allowed during solemnization events. The tea ceremony may be held before or after the solemnization but must comply with requirements such as the social gathering size limit of 5 persons or the cap of 5 visitors a day to a place of residence. Nonetheless, the tea ceremony can be held as part of a wedding reception, amongst the “wedding party”, comprising the wedding couple and up to 18 other attendees, subject to safe management measures for wedding receptions.

    - title: Can we do our pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from our solemnization?
      content: |
        You may do your pre-wedding photo shoots on a separate day from your solemnization. Please check directly with the wedding photographer on the safe management measures that must be adhered to.

    - title: Can we hire a photographer to take photos of my wedding dinner/reception, and can the photographer take photos of guests at each table by adhering to the 1-metre distancing?
      content: |
        Yes, you can hire a photographer to take photos of the wedding reception. A 1-metre distance between the photographer and the subject(s) of photography must be maintained at all times. There must also be no intermingling between the wedding party and guests (i.e. table-to-table photos should be avoided). Masks may be removed momentarily for photo-taking, and must be worn immediately after the photos are taken.

    - title: Can the bride and groom stand/sit on the stage and take photos with the wedding party of 20?
      content: |
        Yes, they can mingle and take photos with one another within the wedding party of 20 attendees (including the bride and groom). For photo-taking, at least 1-metre safe distancing must be observed between the wedding party and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times.

    - title: Can we play video screenings and/or projections of our wedding photos during the reception?
      content: |
        Yes, you can. However, there must be no activities involving live singing, cheering, loud toasting or shouting, or dancing during the reception (with the exception of special provisions for dancing and singing). Please refer to the safe management measures for all wedding-related activities on MTI's GoBusiness website (under Marriage Solemnizations and Receptions) – [https://go.gov.sg/weddingadvisory](https://go.gov.sg/weddingadvisory){:target="_blank"}

    - title: Can weddings that are up to 20 attendees be considered a wedding party where the hosts and guests are allowed to interact as a group?
      content: |
        Yes, if the event size is kept at 20 attendees throughout the entire wedding reception.  From 1 February 2022, all wedding events, irrespective of event size, must implement VDS in order to proceed.

    - title: If I have a small wedding reception now, can I have another reception should the limits be increased subsequently?
      content: |
        The conditions for the holding of marriage solemnizations and wedding receptions during the COVID-19 situation will depend on the prevailing circumstances and policies. Based on the current limit of one reception per couple, a second reception is not allowed.

    - title: If there are certain guests that attend the reception purely to meet and greet the couple and leave straightaway without sitting in to eat and drink, would they be counted as part of the attendee limit?
      content: |
        The total number of attendees includes those who attend the reception for a short duration without eating or drinking, and the relevant VDS requirements apply.

    - title: Are there any duration limits or time restrictions for wedding reception/solemnization?
      content: |
        Couples may choose to hold their solemnization and reception on a separate day, however, each of these events must be completed in the same calendar day. Within the calendar day of each event, there is no fixed time frame/ duration limit, but it is recommended to keep the sessions as brief as possible.

        For solemnizations in other external venues, venue operators reserve the right to impose shorter time limits based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented. For wedding receptions, please also note that liquor cannot be served or consumed after 10.30pm.

    - title: Does the set-up of the ceremony allow for a stage, reception table, etc.?
      content: |
        A stage can be set up as part of the ceremony, but there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests, or between groups of guests. A reception table is allowed, if it is to receive guests when they arrive. However, any interactions should be minimised. E-check-in or other contactless methods of registration should be adopted where possible.

    - title: Is a food line able to be set-up with safe distancing queues and served by the servers at hand?
      content: |
        Food lines are not permitted at wedding events. At wedding receptions, guests are to be served seated at their tables, instead of queuing at the food lines. This is to minimise mingling/crowding, and to reduce interaction amongst different groups of guests. Organisers can offer individually plated or packaged food, and should avoid shared platters or dishes. For marriage solemnizations, food and beverages are strictly not allowed.

    - title: Is onsite cooking allowed at my wedding reception?
      content: |
        On-site cooking is allowed as long as the kitchen staff/personnel remain masked and separated from the guests (similar to a restaurant kitchen). All respective Singapore Food Agency (SFA) and Food & Beverage (F&B) sector guidelines must be adhered to.

    - title: For a zoning arrangement, can I have as many zones as I want?
      content: |
        If the venue permits, you may have multiple zones subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each zone not exceeding 100 attendees, and zoning rules being adhered to (including a 2-metre gap and a continuous physical barrier or a solid partition of 1.8 metre or taller between zones). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes the Solemnizer (for the solemnization), vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). 
        
        We understand venues may have different configurations and encourage couples to work out an optimal arrangement with the venue operator. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access "central" areas, such as the aisle and the stage. All attendees, including the “wedding party”, must be assigned to only one zone. Regardless of the number of zones, entering an unassigned zone is not allowed, except for the wedding couple, who may do so briefly e.g. to take photos. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone. Within each zone, there must be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement for wedding receptions, can I have as many time slots as I want?
      content: |
        If the venue permits, you may have multiple time slots subject to the overall attendance of the entire event comprising the multiple time slots being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 100 attendees, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

        Guests must be assigned to one time slot only, and can only be present in their assigned time slot. Only the “wedding party” (up to 20 attendees) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests, i.e. a 1 metre safe distance between these groups must be observed.

        Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

    - title: Why is the wedding party allowed to remain for each time slot in a staggered timing arrangement, but not allowed to cross zones in a zoning arrangement?
      content: |
        Both arrangements adhere to the safety principle that there should be no more than 100 attendees at one place (zone) at one time (time slot). Within each zone or timeslot, there must similarly be no intermingling and mixing between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests. In a zoning arrangement, only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly (e.g. to take photos).

        In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the wedding throughout the entire event. However, like the physical zoning arrangement, the wedding party must not be intermingling with other groups, and prevailing safe distancing rules, i.e. 1-metre distance between groups, must be observed. Additional safety measures must be taken such as requiring a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted.

    - title: Is the wedding party included in the 100-per-zone cap?
      content: |
        Yes. There must be no more than 100 people in each zone, and each attendee (including the wedding party) must be assigned to only one zone. Couples may choose to configure the zones in a way that allows the wedding couple/party to access "central areas", such as the aisle and the stage. Regardless of the number and configuration of zones, entering an unassigned zone is not allowed, except for the wedding couple who may do so briefly, e.g. to take photos.

    - title: Can I split my wedding party across zones?
      content: |
        Yes. However, once the wedding party is split across zones, they can no longer enter other unassigned zones or interact with other members of the wedding party that are in separate zones during the event. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly, e.g. to take photos, but at least 1-metre safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

    - title: Can the wedding party cross zones?
      content: |
        No, like any attendee, each member of the wedding party must be assigned to one zone only and not enter unassigned zones. There is an exception for the wedding couple, who may cross zones briefly e.g. to take photos, but at least 1-metre safe distancing must be observed between the couple and other groups, as well as between groups, at all times, including for photo-taking. This is to reduce the overall risk exposure for members of the wedding party as well as guests in each zone.

    - title: Can the zone with the wedding party have more than 100 attendees?
      content: |
        No, the number of people in each zone is capped at 100 attendees. This includes the wedding party.

    - title: Can I split my reception into lunch and dinner at the same venue on the same day?
      content: |
        Yes. You may split your reception into lunch and dinner if it is at the same venue and the entire event is completed within a day. This is subject to the overall attendance of the entire event being capped at the maximum allowable limit, the number of people in each time slot not exceeding 100 attendees, and staggered timing rules being adhered to (including a 30-minute gap between time slots). These caps include the couple and the wedding party, but excludes vendors engaged to provide authorised services and venue staff (to be kept to a minimum). The duration of the entire event must be kept within the same calendar day.

        Guests can only arrive and leave in their scheduled timeslot. Only the wedding party (up to 20 attendees) may remain between time slots, whereas all other guests must only belong to one timeslot. There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space (e.g. common/shared surfaces such as seats) and other common areas (e.g. toilets) must be conducted. Within each timeslot, there must be no intermingling between the wedding party and other groups of guests or between groups of guests, i.e. a 1 metre distance between these groups must be observed.

        Venue operators may impose shorter time limits as they deem fit, based on their capacity or ability to ensure safe management measures are implemented.

    - title: Can I split my wedding party across time slots?
      content: |
        Yes. In a staggered timing arrangement, the wedding party is allowed to remain in each timeslot as it is the only way for them to host the reception throughout the day. If you prefer, you may split your wedding party across time slots.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I hold my wedding reception at different venues?
      content: |
        Wedding receptions across different premises are not allowed, although the event may take place in multiple rooms within the same premises managed by the same operator. The couple should provide the full name list of attendees across the different rooms to the venue operator. The entire reception must be completed within the same calendar day and the attendance in different rooms is subject to the maximum allowable limit for a wedding reception.

    - title: For a staggered timing arrangement, can I have my wedding reception across different days?
      content: |
        No. Couples can only hold one reception, which limits the total risk exposure. Even in a staggered timing arrangement, the entire reception must be completed within the same day.

    - title: My wedding venue is large enough to accommodate more than 1,000 attendees for marriage solemnization or 250 attendees for wedding receptions with appropriate safe distancing between groups of 5, is zoning of 100 still necessary?
      content: |
        Yes. Regardless of venue, the number of people in each zone is capped at 100 attendees. All attendees are to be assigned one zone only and entering an unassigned zone is not allowed. This is to minimise participants' total risk exposure and the risk of bunching at common areas including entrances and exits. Organisers are to ensure at least 2-metre safe distancing between zones with the use of physical barriers, e.g. queue poles, or use a solid partition of 1.8 metres or taller between zones. Organisers must also undertake measures to avoid guests crossing between zones. Arrangements must also be made to ensure attendees from different zones do not meet each other at entrances or exits. For instance, organisers could deploy ushers at the entrances and exits of each zone.

    - title: What are the requirements/guidelines for cleaning and disinfection during the intervals between time slots?

        There must be a minimum of 30 minutes between time slots, where cleaning and disinfection at the event space and other common areas must be conducted. Before the start of each time slot and where applicable, the venue owner/operator or organisers must clean and disinfect function spaces, common facilities (e.g. toilets), tables and chairs before and after use, including high-touch areas such as handrails, door handles, lift buttons, etc. It is a good practice for the venue owner/operator or organisers to provide disinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, disinfectant sprays, wipes, etc., for attendees and staff at common or high-touch areas.

    - title: Are common areas such as toilets subject to zonal restrictions?
      content: |
        Organisers are encouraged to designate specific common areas and facilities to specific zones. If this is not possible, organisers should identify hotspots, e.g. entry/exit points, washrooms, corridors, etc., for potential bunching and implement a control mechanism to prevent/disperse crowds, e.g. staggered entrances and exits. This could include the deployment of Safety Ambassadors to remind attendees against clustering and loitering in common areas. Where possible, common surfaces should be wiped down after each use.

    - title: If the wedding party is only part of one zone, does it mean they cannot take photos with guests from the other zone?
      content: |
        Only the wedding couple is allowed to cross zones briefly to take photos. The rest of the wedding party are not allowed to cross zones, like all other attendees. For photo-taking within zones, at least 1m safe distancing must be observed between groups, as well as between the “wedding party” and other groups, at all times, including for photo-taking.

    - title: Do the vendor staff and photographer have to be assigned to zones as well? Can they cross zones?
      content: |
        Vendor staff need not be confined to zones, as they come into contact with participants only transiently and are always masked. The photographer may follow the wedding couple across zones for photo-taking.
