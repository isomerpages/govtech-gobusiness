The Carousel consists of carriers that rotate vertically and deliver stored inventory (e.g. spare parts, small parcels, electronic components) to the operator on the ground.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution159' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Vertical Carousel</a><br/><br/><br/>This solution uses AR technology to simulate welding processes on test pieces. The learning management and student analysis software provides structured curriculum with stimulated exercises and lab practices while tracking trainees' progress. This solution enables more practice with less time spent in workshop, thus reducing material usage, training preparation time/cost, and exposure to safety/health hazards.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution264' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Augmented Reality Welding Training Solution</a><br/><br/><br/>Access to intended in-situ work/inspection/repair locations onboard vessels are usually through the use of scaffolds or rope access operated manually. The process is time-consuming and is physically exhausting. The battery-powered rope ascender can help shipyard/workshop personnel ascend faster,  reduce physical strain on the body and take fewer rest breaks compared to the manual method. This would result in efficiency and productivity improvement.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1143' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Battery-Powered Rope Ascender</a><br/><br/><br/>In the M&O industry, geometric alignment and measurement are needed in many applications such as shaft alignment, line bore applications, flatness/ straightness measurement and machine tool alignment. Traditional alignment methods include visual inspection combined with a straightedge or use of dial indicators, which are inaccurate and time consuming.Laser geometric alignment systems are quick and easy to deploy, and accurate results can be consistently obtained with minimal rework.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1144' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Laser Geometric Alignment System</a><br/><br/><br/>Welding is usually carried out manually by welders or operators of an auto welding carriage. An auto welding carriage mounted to the side-wall can do multiple welding jobs at once, similar to a panel line system with 1 unit being the Master control while the remaining units (min. 2) follow suit using wireless communication. Production line with either 6 or 12 units will only require 1 to 2 welding operators per shift to operate the Master machine while monitoring the overall welding job.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1145' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Auto Welding Carriage</a><br/><br/><br/>Consists of digital welding machines (hardware) and management software- Compute actual real-time output of voltage, reducing manual recording and computing- Allow real-time monitoring of multiple weld stations to ensure welding works are compliant - Provide data logging to track welders' performance/ productivity- Monitor power consumption and consumables- User can pre-set/control welding parameters and optimise voltage applied<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1286' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Digital Welding Equipment </a><br/><br/><br/>Mobile Computer transforms paper-based data recording and manually inventory counting into automate electronic data capture and transmission.

It is very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching. The risk of the operator injuring his hands is also lower as compared to using hammar and chisel. Time is also saved during operation.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2042' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Nut Splitter</a><br/><br/><br/>Battery-operated torque wrench or torque multiplier is a compact and portable tool used to apply specific torque to fasten nut, bolt, or lag screw. This eliminates the need of tedious manual torqing, or use of hydraulic/pneumatic torque equipment which requires additional power source, time and manpower to lay and connect cables/ hoses. With the portable, battery-operated torque wrench, a single worker will be able to carry out torquing independently and in a shorter amount of time.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2079' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Battery-operated Torque Wrench</a><br/>
