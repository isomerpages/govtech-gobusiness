Digital impressions also enable dentists to conduct treatment outcome simulation, as well as data analysis.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $20,000 grant per unit.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2522' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>3D Intraoral Scanner</a><br/>
