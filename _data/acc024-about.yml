    - title: Why do I see two different websites, GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing?
      content: |
        We are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems. During this period, you can still use [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. to apply for licences and keep track of their statuses.
    
    - title: What will happen to my licences after GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing merge?
      content: |
        You will still be able to find your existing licences on [GoBusiness Licensing](https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. For licences that are yet to be approved by GoBusiness Licensing, they will appear on GoBusiness Dashboard after they are approved.

    - title: Do I need to do anything during the transition period when GoBusiness Licensing moves to GoBusiness Singapore?
      content: |
        You should complete your licence applications on GoBusiness Licensing during this period.

        We also recommend updating any bookmarked links to [https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://www.gobusiness.gov.sg/) to ensure the application is submitted through GoBusiness in the future.
    
    - title: Why is the Guided Journey feature only available for F&B businesses?
      content: |
        Guided Journey is being launched in phases, starting with food services businesses. We are currently working towards making it available for more industries.

        In the meantime, you can use our [e-Advisers](/e-services/guides-for-biz/?src=licences_faq) for various business sectors to get recommendations on what to do next.

    - title: How is GoBusiness Dashboard different from GoBusiness Licensing?
      content: |
        GoBusiness Dashboard gives an overview of your Government-to-Business (G2B) transactions in one place, including licences. It also gives personalised recommendations with our e-Advisers, while GoBusiness Licensing is primarily for matters related to licences and permits only.

    - title: I've been using GoBusiness Licensing. Can I continue to use it?
      content: |
        Yes, you can still use GoBusiness Licensing while we are in the midst of merging the GoBusiness Singapore and GoBusiness Licensing systems.

        However, as we are eventually moving all licences to GoBusiness Dashboard, we recommend you start using GoBusiness Dashboard instead.
