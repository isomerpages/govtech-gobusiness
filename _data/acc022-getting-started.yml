  - title: What is the change in the Corppass login process?
    content: |
      From 11 April 2021, the login process for Corppass will be changed to verify the user's identity via Singpass first, before the user can proceed to access and transact with government digital services.

      Note: Foreign ID users will be issued a Singpass Foreign user Account (SFA) and the 'Corppass 2FA for Foreigners' app will no longer be used.

  - title: Why is there a change in the Corppass login process?
    content: |
      Singpass is re-introduced as the login mechanism for businesses to access digital services to simplify the user experience of managing multiple sets of login credentials of corporate transactions.

      While Singpass is used for logins, Corppass will continue to be the authorisation system for corporate transactions. The Corppass portal enables company administrators to specify the digital services that each employee can transact on the company's behalf.

      Having a single Singpass login system, instead of maintaining two separate modes of identity authentication, not only improves convenience for users but also streamlines system operations.

  - title: What does this change mean for the Corppass platform?
    content: |
      Corppass will continue to be the one-stop authorisation system for entities to authorise or remove their employees' access to government digital services on their behalf.
