    content: The AMR replaces manual labour in the transportation of materials and semi/fully completed products around the factory floor during production process. As a collaborative robot for automated internal transportation, AMR comes with autonomous functions to identify obstacles and navigate around factory floor without need for markers or coming to a complete stop for an extended period.

The Carousel consists of carriers that rotate vertically and deliver stored inventory (e.g. spare parts, small parcels, electronic components) to the operator on the ground.Grant support 80% of cost of equipment, up to $30,000 grant<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution161' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Vertical Carousel</a><br/><br/><br/>The hydraulic nut tensioning or hydraulic torqueing wrench is used for bolting, especially in tight spaces. It prevents damage and unnecessary stress due to overtightening. Time and manpower is saved during operation.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution955' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Hydraulic Nut Tensioning/ Hydraulic Torqueing Wrench</a><br/><br/><br/>Consists of digital welding machines (hardware) and management software- Compute actual real-time output of voltage, reducing manual recording and computing- Allow real-time monitoring of multiple weld stations to ensure welding works are compliant - Provide data logging to track welders' performance/ productivity- Monitor power consumption and consumables- User can pre-set/control welding parameters and optimise voltage applied<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1287' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Digital Welding Equipment </a><br/><br/><br/>The flange facer is a cutting tool which prepares flange faces to ensure they have a perfect seal when assembled. This ensures the integrity of the flange joint for operations. The flange facer is usually pneumatically powered. Time is saved during operation as there can be less rework.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1470' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Flange Facer</a><br/><br/><br/>The electrically powered torque multiplier is a compact and lightweight tool that provides repeatable precision when tightening bolts. The torque and angle settings are determined on the display which enables a convenient way of controlling the tool. Time is also saved during operation.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1471' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Torque Multiplier</a><br/><br/><br/>The bristle blaster/ cup brush/ power brush is a handheld tool that is used for surface preparation to effectively remove corrosion and coatings. The bristle wire tips are heat-treated to promote corrosion removal capability and prepare surface roughness up to 120micron. Time is also saved during operation.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1472' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Bristle Blaster / Cup Brush / Power Brush</a><br/><br/><br/>The flange spreader aids the process of separation of two connecting flanges for the replacement of the flange gasket. It aids the maintenance of flange joints through a safe and efficient way.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1473' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Flange Spreader</a><br/><br/><br/>The automatic nut splitter is used to cut through nuts within seconds. It is very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching. The risk of the operator injuring his hands is also lower as compared to using hammar and chisel. Time is also saved during operation.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1474' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Nut Splitter</a><br/><br/><br/>The automated labelling machine replaces manual labelling and can be used for drums, tin cans or carboy, where applicable. Each machine can be customised to fit the unit requirement for eg. standard 200L/120L drum or 1L/3L tin cans/jerry cans.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2075' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automated Labelling Machine </a><br/><br/><br/>Semi-automated or automated filling machine replaces manual filling of liquid into drums/pallet IBC, tin cans or carboy. Machine can be customised to fit the unit requirement e.g. standard 200L/120L drum or 1L/3L tin/jerry cans.Semi-automatic = Operator is largely involved in the process (e.g. place container under nozzles, start the process via switch and transfer container to the next process)Fully automatic = Operator ensures settings are correct, minimal mechanical adjustments required<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2076' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Liquid Filling Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>The explosion proof high pressure industrial vacuum cleaner can handle wet and dry dirt, debris, metal chippings, and liquids. It is a more efficient method of cleaning up at the worksite compared to manual means. Time and manpower reliance can be reduced.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2077' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>High pressure industrial vacuum cleaner</a><br/><br/><br/>The high pressure rotating head features a nozzle that rotates and swivels with high flow rates at a high operating pressure. It can be fixed to various rotors and extensions to cater for cleaning different tanks/vessels. Time and manpower reliance can be reduced when using this equipment.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2078' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>High Pressure Rotating Head</a><br/>

    content: Welding is usually carried out manually by welders or operators of an auto welding carriage. An auto welding carriage mounted to the side-wall can do multiple welding jobs at once, similar to a panel line system with 1 unit being the Master control while the remaining units (min. 2) follow suit using wireless communication. Production line with either 6 or 12 units will only require 1 to 2 welding operators per shift to operate the Master machine while monitoring the overall welding job.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1961' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Auto Welding Carriage</a><br/>
