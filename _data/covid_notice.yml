  <p>From 27 September 2021 to 31 December 2021, Work-From-Home (WFH) will be the default for employees who are able to work from home. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART).</p>

  <p>From 1 January 2022 to 14 January 2022, up to 50% of employees who can work from home are allowed to return to the workplace. Employers must ensure only the following employees can return to the workplace: (i) employees who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme or WHO Emergency Use Listing and their respective post-vaccination duration, (ii) employees who have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180<sup>1</sup> days, (iii) unvaccinated employees who have tested negative for COVID-19 within 24 hours of returning to the workplace, via a Pre-Event Test at an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider. Employees who are medically ineligible for all the vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme, including Sinovac, are exempted from the testing requirement above if they need to work on-site.</p>

  <p>From 15 January 2022 onwards, only employees who are fully vaccinated, certified to be medically ineligible or have recovered from COVID-19 within 180 days, can return to the workplace. The concession for unvaccinated employees to perform PET in lieu of being fully vaccinated will be removed, i.e. such employees will not be allowed to return to the workplace even if they did PET with a negative result. Partially vaccinated employees will still be allowed at workplaces with a negative PET result up to 31 January 2022 after which they must be fully vaccinated.</p>

  <sup>1</sup> From 1 January 2022, all recovered persons from COVID-19 who are not fully vaccinated will only be given a 180-day exemption after infection to enter the workplace. Non-fully vaccinated individuals who had recovered from COVID-19 prior to 1 January 2022 will also have their exemption period reduced from 270 days to 180 days. Such individuals who will already exceed the 180-day period as at 1 January 2022 would be granted an additional one-month grace period till 31 January 2022 to complete their vaccination regime, so as to continue being able to enter the workplace
