    - title: My company's primary business (in ACRA) doesn't fall under the SSIC codes in the Permitted Services List, but we are working on motion picture/TV productions. What should we do? Can my employees or representatives be hired by production houses as crew or talent?
      content: |
        Companies currently not under the [Permitted Services List](/permittedlist/) but providing services (including manpower such as performing talent) to content productions can apply for an exemption (general/time-limited) [with MTI](/covid-19-faqs/), stating clearly the production company they are engaging with, and the production title. Please note the type of exemption will depend on the duration and requirements of the production. 

        For employees or representatives from these companies who are hired separately by production houses as third-party crew or talent (i.e. on a freelance basis), please see the question below.

    - title: Are independent and student filmmakers allowed to resume production activities during Phase 2 – Heightened Alert? What about freelancers?
      content: |
        For Phase 2 – Heightened Alert, companies with SSIC codes under the [Permitted Services List](/permittedlist/) can continue/resume business activities. Freelancers or independent filmmakers who do not have an SSIC code may refer to MTI's FAQs for resumption of operations [here](/covid-19-faqs/), for detailed instructions. 

        Students are to first refer to their respective school advisories on filming activities, as these will take precedence, and would be aligned to MOE directives. 

        In general student filmmakers are allowed to perform filming for schoolwork, as tertiary education institutions are continuing their operations in Phase 2 – Heightened Alert. Please note that only those from graduating cohorts who are required to produce or participate in a film as part of their examination requirements and/or coursework for graduation will be allowed to resume filming activities with the following limitations: 

        a. No more than 15 personnel on location; and 

        b. No more than 10 onscreen talent/performers (who may be unmasked if necessary), at any given time. 

        c. For the entire production, only the same fixed cast of onscreen talent/performers may unmask when needed. This is not interchangeable with other non-onscreen roles. 

        All other student productions not related to graduation requirements should abide by the prevailing regulations and safe management measures, e.g. up to 2 pax with masks on.

        All filmmakers carrying out production work should comply with the [Mandatory Safety Rules](https://www.imda.gov.sg/for-industry/sectors/Media/Film/Filming-in-Singapore){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        Productions with filming or recording of “live” singing are allowed for the following groups of companies: 

        -	Companies already registered with IMDA for higher manpower limits, who may proceed without any further action; OR 

        -	Companies not registered with IMDA, but are under SSIC codes beginning with 59, who are to notify IMDA using the form available under the Resources section of the Filming in Singapore page. 

        These productions must have no more than 2 singers (out of the 10 onscreen talent/performers) unmasked at any given time, and must observe a 2-metre safe distancing from the next person. Even if the singing performers are masked, they count towards the cap of 2 singers. If the singing requires the talent singing face to face, they are to observe more than 2-metres safe distancing.

For onscreen talent, please maintain a 1-metre distance from the next person. Please refer to the [Mandatory Safety Rules](https://www.imda.gov.sg/for-industry/sectors/Media/Film/Filming-in-Singapore){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for details.

        These productions must have no more than 2 singers (out of the 10 onscreen talent/performers) unmasked at any given time, and must observe a 2-metre safe distancing from the next person. Even if the singing performers are masked, they count towards the cap of 2 singers. If the singing requires the talent singing face to face, they are to observe more than 2-metres safe distancing.

    - title: How should production personnel (cast/crew) consume their meals while filming on location? Where can they consume if in public?
      content: |
        Meals should be packaged individually with disposable packaging/utensils, and safe distancing measures should be adhered to. If the personnel are not able to take their meals at their work premises as they are filming on location, they can eat in their vehicles, or in public spaces such as void decks and park benches. 

        Production companies should ensure that all personnel observe the following while doing so: 

        a. Personnel should dine alone or at most with one other person, and keep a distance of at least one metre from another individual; 

        b. Staggered meal times to reduce the interactions between personnel and prevent congregation; and 

        c. Personnel should dine quickly and leave the space in a clean state after they have consumed their meals. 

        Refer to the [Mandatory Safety Rules](https://www.imda.gov.sg/for-industry/sectors/Media/Film/Filming-in-Singapore){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} on how to implement this.

    - title: The Mandatory Safety Rules makes clear that all personnel must maintain a 1 metre safe distance from the next person. Would it be possible to have short or transient contact with fellow cast/crew for the purpose of preparing for the production, such as for swopping camera lens, lifting heavy equipment together, passing items to actors etc with masks on?
      content: |
        It is understandable that very brief or transient contact may be encountered in the middle of a production, similar to making payments for a meal at a food establishment, or receiving a delivery. The production company should note to encourage all production personnel to keep such contact brief and maintain the 1 metre safe distancing at all times throughout the production. The 1 metre safe distancing applies to all onscreen talent/performers (i.e. casts) too.

    - title: If the filming location identified is a business whose SSIC is not under the Permitted Services List in Phase 2 – Heightened Alert, can production still take place?
      content: |
        Businesses not permitted to operate must apply to the Ministry of Trade and Industry for a time-limited exemption via here if they wish to use their premises for content production purposes. Filming in such premises may be allowed, subject to the permission granted by the establishment and the ability to comply with the Mandatory Safety Rules (e.g. maintaining a safe distance of at least 1m between all individuals during production). This includes planning for the limited number of personnel on set at a time, due to space constraints. For onscreen talent who is unmasked, it is mandatory to maintain a 1m distance from the next person at all times. 

        Businesses not permitted to operate should not use such filming as a reason to conduct their business activities which had not been allowed to operate onsite. Doing so could be a breach of the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) (Control Order) Regulations 2020 (“Control Order”), for which upon conviction of a first offence the penalty is a fine of up to a maximum of $10,000, imprisonment of up to a maximum of 6 months, or both.

      content: |
        Filming requests in gardens, parks and nature reserves managed by the National Parks Board will be assessed based on factors such as the location, proposed filming hours, and whether the crew can observe safe-distancing measures. Please note that as far as possible, filming is to be done on weekdays during off peak periods, and to limit crew numbers and hours to minimise crowding. Companies can submit their applications via the NParks website, at least 2 weeks prior to their production: [https://www.nparks.gov.sg/request-to-film-on-location-form](https://www.nparks.gov.sg/request-to-film-on-location-form){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} 

        Filming in open areas will be subject to the permission of the respective location owners, where required.

    - title: Can productions take place in locations managed by Town Councils (e.g. HDB common areas such as void decks)?
