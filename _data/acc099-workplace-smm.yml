        For companies resuming operations after the circuit breaker period, all Safe Management Measures should be in place before operations can be resumed at the workplace.

    - title: Do I have to apply to resume operations at my company's workplace premises?
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Task Force has announced that selected activities and services are allowed to resume operations. Companies that fall under the list of activities and services do not need to apply before resuming operations. Please go to [https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg) for more details.

    - title: Are the requirements mandatory, and what enforcement actions will MOM take against businesses that do not implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        MOM and sector agencies will take calibrated enforcement actions based on the areas of non-compliance found. For workplaces that severely lack Safe Management Measures, we will direct employers to stop operations at the workplace. Employers will have to take steps to ensure that Safe Management Measures are in place before operations can resume.

        Failure to comply with Safe Management Measures is punishable with a fine of up to $10,000 or imprisonment of up to 6 months or both. Repeated non-compliance is punishable with a fine of up to $20,000 or imprisonment of up to 12 months, or both.

    - title: Who is empowered to enforce the requirements and how can I verify the identity of enforcement officers inspecting my workplace?
      content: |
        Enforcement action may be taken by any inspector who is appointed under section 7 of the Workplace Safety and Health Act. You may request for the inspector to show his or her certificate of appointment. 

    - title: Where can I find more guidance on implementing Safe Management Measures in the workplace?

        Unionised companies are also encouraged to engage their unions on such arrangements.

    - title: Is it compulsory to fill in and maintain the checklist provided in Annex B?
      content: |
        [Annex B - Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} sets out the requirements needed for employers to resume operations. Employers are not required to fill out the checklist, but must ensure that the documents listed in the checklist (or equivalent) are available upon request by officials.

        When inspected by any government agency, businesses must be prepared to show that they have fulfilled the requirements listed.

    - title: Are there specific Safe Management Measures for each sector (e.g. construction, F&B, retail)?
      content: |
        The requirements on Safe Management Measures at the workplace released by MOM is for general workplace settings. For specific workplace settings or sector requirements, please refer to [guidelines issued by the respective sector agencies](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector).

    - title: We have received two advisories, one from MOM and another from the sector agency. Which one do we follow?
      content: |
        The advisory on Safe Management Measures and the accompanying checklist issued by MOM are for general workplace settings. Where there may be sector-specific considerations, companies should also refer to the sector-specific advisories issued, over and above MOM's advisory.

    - title: My employees do not have a specific workplace as they are deployed to client's site to provide goods and services. How can I implement Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        All employers must implement Safe Management Measures at their workplaces for all employees and contractors. 

        Companies that have employees deployed to other sites should ensure that their employees comply with the Safe Management Measures put in place at these sites. In fact, some of the Safe Management Measures can be implemented by employers regardless of where employees are deployed, such as health monitoring.

    - title: If my business activities are not listed in the permitted services list, can I apply for an exemption to resume business activities?
      content: |
        Businesses should suspend operations in their premises from 7 April 2020 onwards until they are approved by MTI to continue operations or their list of business activity falls within the [permitted list](htps://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/faq/resumption/resumption/) allowed to operate from 2 June 2020.

        Employers whose business operations are not in the list of permitted services may still return to their business facility to take care of crucial tasks that cannot be done remotely or to retrieve necessary materials or documents. No application for exemption is required.

        However, if employees have to be activated to return to the workplace for short periods of time (i.e. less than a day), employers are required to apply to MTI for a time-limited exemption to do so. If employers need to maintain a skeletal workforce at the workplace for longer periods, an application for a general exemption should be submitted instead.

    - title: My company is currently operating under a General Exemption, as our business activities are currently not listed in the permitted services list. Can our employees who are currently working from home return to the workplace?

        MOM will treat each report seriously and will keep your identity strictly confidential.

    - title: Is there a limit to the number of migrant workers a company can deploy at each renovation site?
      content: |
        Contractors should deploy a minimal number of workers at renovation workplaces and must ensure that Ministry of Manpower's Safe Management Measures at workplaces are complied with at renovation workplaces to mitigate the risk of community transmission. All personnel on site must observe safe management measures such as clear physical distancing, wearing of masks and must avoid socialising or congregating in groups.

    - title: If my renovation project involves more than one team of contractors, are they allowed to work at the same renovation site at the same time?

However, all personnel on site must observe safe management measures such as clear physical distancing, wearing of masks and must avoid socialising or congregating in groups. 

        The application of safe management measures will vary depending on the renovation site. Employers should assess and evaluate the measures that must be taken to ensure safe distancing and ensure that the risk of COVID-19 spread at workplaces is minimised for their workers. This may include additional measures such as having staggered rest, arrival and exit timings to minimise interactions between workers from different companies.

    - title: My office is on a 5-day week. Can all my employees work at the office for 3 days a week, and then work from home for 2 days?
      content: |
        No. From <b>1 January 2022</b>, up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home are allowed to return to the workplace at any point in time. You can consider other arrangements that will meet this requirement, for instance:
        
        * Divide your employees into 2 groups, with 1 group working from home for any given week.
        * Divide your employees into 2 groups, with a different group working from home for each day Monday to Thursday, and both groups working from home on Friday.
        
        Additionally, only the following individuals can return to the workplace: (i) workers who are fully vaccinated with a vaccine under the National Vaccination Programme or WHO Emergency Use Listing and their respective post-vaccination duration, (ii) workers who have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days, (iii) workers who are not fully vaccinated who have tested negative for COVID-19 within 24 hours of returning to the workplace, via a Pre-Event Test (PET) at an MOH-approved COVID-19 test provider, (iv) workers who are medically ineligible for all the vaccines under the National Vaccination Programme.

        From 15 January 2022, workers who are not fully vaccinated are not to enter the workplace, even with a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result.

        Employers are strongly encouraged to make plans for employees, contractors, and vendors who report to the workplace to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test. 

    - title: Should my employees be masked at all times? What if my worker has medical condition?
      content: |
        Every individual should put on a mask at all times, except when eating, drinking or consuming medication, or engaging in strenuous physical exercise.  However, if the individual has severe medical conditions, he may wear a face shield in lieu of a mask. 

    - title: What should I do if my employees are unwilling to work from home because their home is not conducive for work?
      content: |
        The overarching objective of these regulations is to reduce physical interactions in order to prevent spread of COVID-19. Employers can consider different ways to implement working arrangements that comply with the Safe Management Measures for the workplace, while taking business and employee preferences into account. 

        From <b>1 January 2022</b>, up to 50% of employees who are able to work from home are allowed to return to the workplace at any point in time. Employers can prioritise such employees to return to the workplace. 

    - title: As most of my employees are either doing frontline work or fieldwork operations, it is not feasible for me to rearrange the work such that they can work-from-home. Will I be penalised for not providing such work arrangements?
      content: |
        Employers must demonstrate the business or operational reasons why the workers working at the workplace are unable to work-from-home despite review and redesign of work processes. Our inspectors will assess the efforts put in by companies to implement work-from-home arrangements based on the practicality of whether the workers can work-from-home given the nature of the job.

        For the safety of workers at the workplace, employers should put in place other Safe Management Measures at the workplace (e.g. ensuring safe distancing, ensuring use of SafeEntry, etc) to provide a safe working environment and minimise risk of further outbreaks.

    - title: Are there any available resources to help my business review work processes to enable employees to work-from-home?
      content: |

        * Staff providing decoration, lighting, sound or other equipment for hire.
        
        * Those who are involved in event setup only. 

    - title: Are companies required to ensure staggered start times for employers at the workplace?
      content: |
        Employers are encouraged to stagger the start times for all employees who are unable to work from home (due to the nature of their work, or their work can only be done with equipment that is confined to the workplace) such that at least half of all employees arrive at the workplace at or after 10am, as far as possible. This would enable more employees to avoid peak-hour travel, especially if employees require the use of public transport. Timings of lunch and other breaks should also be staggered accordingly.

    - title: Are employees and visitors required to wear a mask at all times at the workplace?
      content: |
        For general office workplaces, employers must ensure that employees and visitors wear a mask at all times at the workplace, except during activities that require masks to be removed or when individuals are alone in their own office. Supplementary personal protective equipment is encouraged, whenever relevant (more guidelines can be found in sector-specific guidelines). This is in addition to other safe management measures (e.g. safe distancing) that must be in place at the workplace. 

        Some examples of activities where the requirement for masks to be worn can be waived include mealtimes, or where other equipment must be worn during the course of work (e.g. motorcycle helmets). 

        The requirement for masks to be worn can also be waived for individuals who are alone in their own office, and when no one other than the individual enters the room. If there is any physical contact with people, or if anyone else enters the room, the mask must be put on.

        Where possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to wear their masks.

        From 15 January 2022, individuals who are not fully vaccinated are not to visit the workplace, even with a negative Pre-Event Test (PET) result. 

    - title: What forms of personal protective equipment should my employees use? Can employees wear other forms of PPEs (e.g. face shields) instead of surgical masks?
      content: |
        A mask that closely and completely covers the nose and mouth (i.e. without leaving a gap between the mask and the face) must be worn at all times when persons go out of their homes, including while at the workplace.

        The following specific groups of persons may use a face shield, in place of masks:
        1.  Children 12 years and below, who may have difficulty wearing and keeping face masks on for a prolonged period of time; 
        2.  Persons who have health conditions that may result in breathing or other medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period of time; and
        3.  Persons who are speaking to a group in a classroom or lecture-style setting, where they largely remain at the spot from which they are speaking, and are able to maintain a safe distance away from any other persons. 

        A face shield has to be must be worn properly so that it covers the entire face, from the forehead to below the chin, wrapping around the sides of the face.

        Plastic spit guards predominantly cover the mouth and are not considered as masks. Face coverings such as neck gaiters, bandannas, scarves or handkerchiefs are not considered as masks.

        If the risk of encountering an infectious person is high (e.g. personnel has sustained contact with many other individuals throughout the course of their work), then surgical masks and other relevant PPEs should be used instead.

    - title: Can my employees use employer-provided recreational facilities which are not located at the workplace?
      content: |
        Access to standalone recreational facilities which are located away from employees' workplaces will depend on the re-opening plans for relevant permitted enterprises. These facilities will also be subject to stricter safe management measures (e.g. maintaining a distance of at least 2 – 3 metres from each other when engaging in any sporting activity or physical exercise). When visiting such facilities, employees will still have to comply with the relevant safe management measures put in place for that setting.

    - title: Are there any approval or notification required for work-related events with up to 50 participants?
      content: |
        No. The work related event can proceed with the following safe management measures in place.
        
        a. Attendees must maintain at least 1 metre safe distancing between individual attendees, as per the requirement at the workplace.
        
        b. Meals should not be the main feature of the event, i.e. food or drinks should only be served if incidental to the workplace event (e.g. the meeting or conference extends over lunchtime). In addition, the food must be served individually with the participants seated while consuming. Participants should minimise the time that they are unmasked while eating.
        
        c. Work-related events held at third-party venues will also be subject to any additional premises owners' safe management policies such as Vaccination Differentiated SMMs.
        
        d. High risk activities such as singing and the playing of wind or brass instruments are not allowed to resume at work-related events.

    - title: Do I need to wait for any approval after I submit the notification for work related event Work-related events with 51-1000 participants?

    - title: What constitutes as ‘authorised visitors' allowed to visit the workplace?
      content: |
        This refers to visitors who are visiting the workplace for official reasons, including but not limited to:

        - Suppliers or contractors who need to be physically onsite to deliver their goods and services
        - Buyers who are onsite to collect their goods and services
        - Visitors who need to attend a physical meeting within the workplace premises

        This excludes visitors who may visit the workplace for leisure purposes.

    - title: Can I use an alternative visitor management system instead of SafeEntry?
      content: |
        Businesses must use Trace-Together-only SafeEntry to collect entry information of all employees and visitors on their premises. Businesses that need to use their current systems to collect additional data, e.g. employees' ID, must ensure Trace-Together-only SafeEntry is implemented on top of their existing systems. 

    - title: Trace-Together-only SafeEntry is already implemented for my building (e.g. malls), do tenants within the building have to implement it as well?

    - title: In an office setting, would leaving an empty desk marked (e.g. with a cross) suffice for safe distancing? For barriers between workstations, are there guidelines for how high they need to be?
      content: |
        Employers must ensure clear physical spacing of at least 1m between persons at all times and demarcate safe physical distances (at least 1m apart) with visual indicators or physical means such as barriers between work stations. If leaving an empty desk and demarcating clearly with visual indicators allows for at least 1m distancing between employees, such an approach can be considered. For barriers between workstations, while there are no specific height guidelines, the barriers should also facilitate the required safe physical distance of 1m apart.

    - title: How frequently should I clean my workplace, i.e. what is considered regular cleaning?
      content: |
        As the recommended frequency and intensity may differ by sector, businesses should refer to the sanitation and hygiene advisories disseminated by the National Environmental Agency (NEA) [here](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

        - Ensuring employees at the workplace who have visited a clinic submit to you records of their Medical Certificates (MCs) and diagnoses provided (only for COVID-19-related symptoms, including acute respiratory infections), and if they were tested for COVID-19 and the results of their tests
        - Advising employees who are unwell to stay home and consult a doctor rather than going to the workplace
        - Requiring employees on MCs to closely monitor their health before returning to the workplace
        - Requiring close contacts of employees on MCs to monitor their health more regularly

    - title: What should be included in my monitoring plan?
      content: |
        The monitoring plan should at minimum, include details on the steps taken to ensure the requirements are communicated and adhered to, and how any anomalies or non-compliance will be identified. The plan should also highlight risk mitigation strategies and proposed steps to remedy and document any non-compliance found.

        You may refer to [Annex B](https://www.mom.gov.sg/-/media/mom/documents/covid-19/annex-b-checklist-of-safe-management-measures.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} of the Safe Management Measures requirements, Checklist of Safe Management Measures at the Workplace for Resumption of Business Activities, for guidance on what should be included in the monitoring plan.

    - title: Who can we appoint as a Safe Management Officer?
      content: |
        Companies should appoint someone capable of carrying out the duties stated in MOM's requirements for workplace Safe Management Measures within the organisation as the designated Safe Management Officer(s) (SMOs). For unionised companies, union leaders or Workplace Safety and Health officers could be appointed as SMOs. 

        Companies should ensure that SMOs are provided with sufficient resources and guidance to carry out their duties effectively.

        SMOs can be part-time appointments.

    - title: How do I ensure that my employees adhere to Safe Management Measures?
      content: |
        Employers are responsible for ensuring that Safe Management Measures are in place, communicated and explained to employees prior to resuming work. Signs should also be put up to remind employers and visitors to observe all measures in place.

    - title: Can my company be exempted from Safe Management Measures when my employees are vaccinated?
      content: |
        We are still monitoring the duration of the vaccine's protection and its effectiveness in preventing transmission of COVID-19.

        Until enough people are vaccinated, you should continue to practise public health measures such as [Workplace Safe Management Measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. This will help to continue protect ourselves and our loved ones

    - title: 	Do I need to implement temperature screening for my employees?
      content: |
        No. This requirement was lifted on 19 August 2021.

    - title: What should I take into consideration when engaging employees on returning to the workplace?
      content: |
        You are encouraged to have a transparent and open discussion with employees on the work arrangements, taking into consideration factors such as: 
        
        - Business needs and nature of work, i.e. task requires employees to be physically in office
        - Readiness of workforce, e.g. infrastructure, IT support, onboarding of new hires, etc.
        - Implications on remuneration package, e.g. savings from office space rental, transport allowances, etc. 
        - Sensitivity towards certain groups of employees, i.e. older and more vulnerable employees, employees identified by MOH as not suitable to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, employees with caregiving needs

        Having a clear set of guidelines or workplace policies on the work arrangements would help prevent misunderstandings or disputes. 
        
        You may wish to refer to TAFEP's telecommuting guide for more details on implementing a sustainable telecommuting arrangement or to approach TAFEP on work-life programmes that can be implemented at the workplace. 

    - title: Do I need to conduct a deep cleaning of my workplace premises?
      content: |
        No. Common spaces include entrances, lifts lobbies, meeting rooms, pantries as well as shared machinery and equipment should be cleaned in accordance with [NEA's advisory](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/guidelines){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. You are not required to enlist a cleaning contractor. 

    - title: One of my workers is infected with COVID-19, and I want to conduct ART for employees who might have been in contact. What type of interactions should count?
      content: |
        You should make an assessment based on your workplace setting. For instance, those whom the infected worker had meals with, or those who were at a long meeting with them, may be at risk of infection. Even if they did not receive a Health Risk Warning, you may wish to conduct ART to ensure that they are safe and reduce transmission risk.

        It is important that employers ensure that the risk of transmission at the workplace is reduced to as low as possible even as we transit to an endemic situation. Otherwise, employers may face severe disruption to their operations if more workers are infected.

  data:
    - title: Who are included in the computation of my company's vaccination rate at https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated?
      content: |
        All your employees are included in the computation of your company's vaccination rate. This generally includes interns, temporary staff, and part-time staff. 
        
        Persons who are not employees, such as vendors, contractors, and consultants, are not included in the computation of your company's vaccination rate.

    - title: When is an employee considered vaccinated?
      content: |
        An employee is considered vaccinated if he/ she has been: a) fully vaccinated, i.e. has received the appropriate regimen of World Health Organisation Emergency Use Listing (WHO EUL) vaccines including their respective duration post-vaccination for the vaccine to be fully effective, and had their vaccination records ingested in MOH's national IT systems ; b) recovered from COVID-19 and within 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection. 

    - title: Are employees who recovered from COVID-19 but unvaccinated counted towards the vaccination rate of the company?
      content: |
        Yes. Employees who recovered from COVID-19 will be counted to the vaccination rate if they are within 270 days from the date of COVID-19 infection. 

    - title: How do I check a specific employee's vaccination status? 
      content: |
        MOM is not able to provide the details of vaccinated and unvaccinated employees. As stated in the [Updated Advisory on COVID-19 Vaccination at the Workplace](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, employers may ask employees for their vaccination status for the purpose of planning deployment at the workplace.

    - title: Some employees joined my company recently. Is the information on the portal updated?
      content: |
        Your results at the portal will be updated 2-3 months after your new employees join.

    - title: The vaccination rate of my company is different than what is reflected at https://go.gov.sg/percentvaccinated. Why is this so?
      content: |
        There is a time lag for government administrative data to be updated. Employers may refer to their own records when this happens.

    - title: My employees are vaccinated with the Sinovac-Coronavac vaccine. Are they considered vaccinated? 
      content: |
        The Multi-Ministry Taskforce will include the Sinovac-CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccine in the National Vaccination Programme, following the interim authorisation of the vaccine by the Health Sciences Authority. Those who have taken two doses of Sinovac-Coronavac will be regarded as fully vaccinated for four months after the second dose, or 31 December 2021, whichever is later.
