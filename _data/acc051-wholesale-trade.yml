Heat is applied to the ends of the film to form a sealed package. The equipment is widely used in the fresh produce sector as it ensures the products are wrapped securely based on the size and shape of the product or tray.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1986' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Flow Wrap Packaging Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>Shrink wrapping is a procedure where an item is wrapped in a free sleeve or envelope of loose shrink film, and heat is applied to shrink the wrap firmly around the product. The result is a tight, clear wrap around the product, preventing damage from dirt, dust, and moisture. Shrink wrap packaging is used for a variety of products and is widely used in the fresh produce sector.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution1987' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Automatic Shrink Wrap Packaging Machine</a><br/><br/><br/>An equipment which eliminates ethylene gas in the air effectively. Ethylene that is released naturally can be continuously removed by the equipment. No amount of harmful substance (e.g. ozone) should be released as a result of removing the ethylene. Equipment is to be used in cold storage warehouses and production facilities for the purpose of extending the shelf life of fresh produce.<br/><br/><a href='/productivity-solutions-grant/solutionrepo/solution2001' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Ethylene Removal System</a><br/>
