  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to continue on-site instruction?
    content: |
      MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online. 

      Up to 50% of those who can work from home are allowed to return to the office. Centres that continue on-site instruction or have employees who return to the workplace are required to abide by the nationwide [safe management measures for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to reduce risk of transmission of COVID-19. These include the use of SafeEntry to support contact tracing for all employees, wearing of masks at all times, no social gatherings at the workplace and regular cleaning of common facilities and high-touch areas. Employers should continue to implement flexible working hours and stagger the start times of employees who need to return to the workplace. Employees who are unable to work from home are strongly encouraged to self-test weekly via an Antigen Rapid Test (ART), to keep the workplace safe. More information on prevailing workplace safe management measures can be found on the MOM website ([https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).

      Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days, can return to the workplace. More information can be found on the MOM website ([https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).

      As part of Singapore's national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the Fast and Easy Testing (FET) 7-day regime for onsite employees. The latest details are on: [https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet](https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
      
      As a default, the following SMMs apply to all centres conducting on-site instruction (whether indoors or outdoors and regardless of activity), except where there are additional safe management measures that apply for higher-risk activities such as sports or physical activity, dance, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes (please refer to Q2 for details on additional SMMs for high movement activities or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread, and Q3 for classes that involve mask-off activities).

      a. **Safe distancing.** Safe distancing measures for centres which are allowed to continue on-premise instruction are:

        i. <u>Students:</u> Centres must ensure safe distancing between students by putting up appropriate floor demarcations and/or physical barriers, e.g. using safety tape. There must also be strict separation between students in different classrooms at all times, with no intermingling.
          <br>- As a default, centres must ensure that all students maintain safe distancing of at least 1m at all times, with strictly no physical interaction between students. 
          <br>- If it is not possible to apply 1m safe distancing between students and some interaction is unavoidable, centres may instead organise students into groups of no more than 5 **<u>students</u>**, with strictly no physical interaction or intermingling between different groups. Centres must strictly maintain a minimum of 1m spacing between groups, although MOE advises 2m spacing between groups as a best practice.

        ii. <u>Tutors/instructors:</u> Tutors/instructors are advised to minimise contact with students. If some interaction is unavoidable, contact with students should be transient, and they should remain at the front of the class as much as is practicable.

        iii. <u>Capacity:</u> No single room within a centre should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors, even as the above measures are adopted.

        iv. Centres are also reminded that per MOM's guidelines for workplaces, should there be staff deployed on site, centres must strictly ensure that there is  be no cross-deployment across worksites. No staff should work at more than one worksite to reduce the risk of infection caused by inter-mingling. More information on prevailing workplace SMMs can be found on the MOM website ([https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      b. **Health declarations.** Students and staff who are on Health Risk Warning (HRW) are encouraged to minimise unnecessary social interactions. In the event that they need to enter the centre, they may only be allowed to enter the centre if they produce photo-evidence of a negative ART taken on that day. We also advise centres to watch out for staff and students with fever or respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, breathlessness, runny nose, loss of sense of smell, cough, or sore throat. Staff and students with the above symptoms or who are unwell should be advised to leave the centre and see a doctor immediately, and should not be allowed to attend lessons.

      c. **Disinfection of surfaces.** All surfaces in classrooms must be thoroughly disinfected between classes. Sharing of all equipment (e.g. props, microphones) should be avoided as far as possible. If this cannot be done, the equipment should be thoroughly cleaned and/or disinfected before being handled or used by others. However, please note that sharing of wind/brass instruments or parts thereof (e.g. mouthpieces, reeds) is not allowed.

      d. **Masks must be worn as a default at all times,** except for persons allowed to use face shields instead of masks (e.g. persons with health conditions resulting in breathing/medical difficulties when a mask is worn for a prolonged period). Instructors are expected to wear a surgical mask or reusable masks of equivalent effectiveness at all times.

      e. **Class timings.** Centres must allocate at least 15 minutes between classes. This is to allow adequate time to disinfect classroom surfaces, and to ensure strict separation of individuals from different classes. Centres should also work out attendance and dismissal arrangements that help avoid congestion of individuals in or outside the centre. 

      f. **Ventilation.** All premises should abide by the latest guidance on improving ventilation and indoor air quality in buildings amid the COVID-19 situation, available on the [NEA website](https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/public-cleanliness/environmental-cleaning-guidelines/advisories/guidance-on-improving-ventilation-and-indoor-air-quality-in-buildings-amid-the-covid-19-situation){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      Centres should also abide by other sector-specific Safe Management Measures available on the [GoBusiness website](https://covid.gobusiness.gov.sg/safemanagement/sector/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and to prevailing circulars issued by the Government.

  - title: Some tuition and enrichment classes involve high movement activities (e.g. sports, dance), or activities which carry a higher risk of virus transmission through droplet spread (e.g. singing, wind/brass instruments). What additional safe management measures should be implemented?
    content: |
      Additional safe management measures (SMMs) may apply for these classes, subject to different class size and group size limits, depending on the activity, setting, and vaccination status of students. These additional SMMs do not apply if students only remove their masks very briefly, for example, to taste food in a cooking class, and mask up immediately thereafter.

      For all sport or physical activity classes, as well as outdoor dance classes, please refer to the advisory issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      For indoor dance classes, singing, the playing of instruments that require the intentional expulsion of air (e.g. wind/brass instruments), voice training, and speech and drama classes, please refer to the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/support/covid-19/safe-management-measures-smms){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      For more details on the implementation of FET, please refer to the notification issued by [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/support/covid-19/safe-management-measures-smms/fast-and-easy-testing-for-higher-risk-arts-instructions-activities){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and the notification issued by [ActiveSG](https://www.myactivesg.com/read/2021/7/a-safe-and-gradual-resumption-of-sport-and-fitness-activities-with-mandatory-fast-and-easy-testing){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: What are the additional safe management measures for classes that involve mask-off activities?
    content: |
      All activities involving mask-off activities are subject to additional safe management measures (on top of the prevailing safe management measures (please refer to Q1) that all classes are required to comply with).

      a. For all sport or physical activity classes, as well as outdoor dance classes, please refer to the advisory issued by [Sport Singapore](https://www.sportsingapore.gov.sg/Newsroom/Media-Releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

      b.

      c. For classes that require the consumption of food and beverage (F&B) as part of the class (e.g. dining etiquette classes), please refer to the advisory for F&B establishments issued by [Enterprise Singapore](http://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/covid-19){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for the relevant SMMs. Do note that apart from these classes, students should keep their masks on at all times, and not consume any food and drinks during classes, as far as possible

      These additional SMMs do not apply if students only remove their masks very briefly, for example, to taste food in a cooking class, and mask up immediately thereafter.
      
  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for in person lessons operating out of private residences?
    content: |
      MOE strongly encourages that all tuition and enrichment classes be conducted online. Home-based tuition/enrichment that conduct in-person lessons, will be subject to the prevailing national group size limit and number of unique household visitors allowed per day. Individuals who visit private residences to provide tuition and enrichment are also recommended to ensure they are within the prevailing national limit for number of social household visits allowed, and are strongly advised to only visit other residences if they are fully vaccinated, so as to protect those who are unvaccinated from exposure to the virus. The prevailing national limits can be found at [https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory](https://www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19-phase-advisory){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.
      
      In addition, home ventilation should be improved by opening doors and windows. Fans can be used to promote air circulation when needed.

  - title: Can tuition and enrichment centres that are allowed to conduct face-to-face classes switch to online learning?
    content: |
      Yes, tuition and enrichment centres providing face-to-face classes can consider switching to online lessons. Centres should review the safe management measures that they are able to put in place and can make their own business decisions regarding the conduct of online learning, taking into consideration the efficacy of instruction and the needs and expectations of students/parents.

  - title: Can employees of private tuition and enrichment centres continue to work at the workplace, even if centres have switched to online learning?
    content: |
      Up to 50% of those who can work from home are allowed to return to the office. Only employees who are fully vaccinated, or have recovered from COVID-19 within the past 180 days, can return to the workplace. More information can be found on the MOM website ([https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-covid-19-vaccination-in-employment-settings){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}).
      
      Tuition and enrichment centres are required to abide by the nationwide [safe management measures for workplaces](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/requirements-for-safe-management-measures){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. Tele-conferencing should be used in place of in-person meetings as far as possible.

  - title: Are private schools, including tuition and enrichment centres, allowed to hold year-end concerts or performances on their premises?
    content: |
      Tuition and enrichment centres may resume live performances (e.g. music concerts or drama performance) with MOE's approval, subject to adherence to safe management measures as outlined in the advisory issued by the [National Arts Council](https://www.nac.gov.sg/support/covid-19/safe-management-measures-smms/updated-resumption-of-live-performances){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. 

      Centres who wish to seek approval to proceed with live performances should write to [moe_pss@moe.gov.sg](mailto:moe_pss@moe.gov.sg) with the following details, at least three weeks in advance of the proposed event date:
      
      a. Purpose of event, date and time;

      b. Total number of performers and crew participating in live performance; and

      c. Total number of on-site audience. 

  - title: Are all tutors/instructors/staff at private tuition or enrichment centres required to undergo Fast and Easy Testing (FET) regimes?
    content: |
      As part of Singapore's national efforts to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19, enterprises in the Private Tuition and Enrichment Sector are required to comply with the FET 7-day regime. The latest details are on: [https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet](https://go.gov.sg/tuition-enrichment-fet){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions be held in external venues (e.g. function rooms)?
    content: |
      Private tuition/enrichment classes, and training sessions by the Institutes of Higher Learning and SSG-funded training providers, can be conducted at external venues, if those venues are open. Such external venues may include condominium function rooms, private conference and meeting rooms, etc. 

      Conduct of in-person lessons is subject to premise capacity caps and safe management measures(please refer to Q1). Private providers should approach premise owners for advice on the capacity caps for their respective venues. No single room should hold more than 50 persons, including tutors/instructors/trainers, subject to further capacity limits for masked sports/dance/speech/voice training/drama classes, or the premise capacity cap, <u>whichever is lower.</u> 

      There should be a wipe-down regimen after each use at such external venues. Private providers must also adhere to the safe management guidelines for private tuition/enrichment and CET courses, which are outlined in the FAQs within this section.

  - title: What are the safe management measures that should be implemented for Continuing Education and Training (CET) courses for adults? 
    content: |
      MOE strongly encourages that these classes be conducted online.

      For classes that are conducted in person, they are subject to safe management requirements(please refer to Q1) and additional safe management measures specified in here (please refer to Q2) and here (please refer to Q3) as applicable.
      Specifically for SSG-funded CET programmes, SSG's prevailing guideline for a maximum class size of 40 persons (excluding the trainer(s)) for course quality reasons remains and takes precedence.

  - title: Will the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system and the SafeEntry Gateway Device (SEGW) be implemented for tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers?
    content: |
      On 4 May 2021, the Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) announced that TraceTogether-only SafeEntry (TT-only SafeEntry) will be implemented at all venues that experience higher throughput of visitors, and/or where people are likely to be in close proximity for prolonged periods from 17 May 2021. The TT programme and SafeEntry are important digital tools that enable contact tracers to quickly identify and isolate close contacts of COVID-19 cases. This helps to break transmission chains and prevent community outbreaks. TT tokens may be collected at designated collection points (please refer to [https://token.gowhere.gov.sg](https://token.gowhere.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} for more information).

      Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers must therefore ensure that TT-only SafeEntry is implemented in your premises, and that entry to your centres will be allowed only if the individual uses their TT App to scan the centre's QR code or presents the QR code on the TT token to be scanned. This includes staff, students aged 7 years and above, parents and other visitors.

      It is mandatory for all tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers to deploy SafeEntry Gateway (SEGW) to facilitate SafeEntry (SE) check-in for students aged 7 years and above, parents, staff and visitors, and help users check that their TT token is working. Tuition, enrichment centres and SSG-funded training providers are reminded to download the SafeEntry (Business) app to use the SEGW function or register for a SEGW box on the SE website (go.gov.sg/gateway-overview). Centres should maintain attendance records for children below 7 to facilitate contact tracing if required.  

      At the point of entry into the centres, if any student forgets to bring their TT token, they should be asked to download the TT app on their phones before they are allowed entry. However, if the student is unable to do so (e.g. phone is out of battery), the student's personal details should be noted down as a last resort, before the individual is granted entry. The centre should retain all such records for at least a month to facilitate contact tracing if necessary. 

      Business may refer to the SafeEntry User Guide for requirements on how to scan the TT tokens, available at [https://www.safeentry.gov.sg](https://www.safeentry.gov.sg){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}(please navigate to Resources > User Guide > SafeEntry NRIC User Guide for Business). Updates may also be found at [https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases](https://www.smartnation.gov.sg/whats-new/press-releases){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

  - title: Will private tutors providing in-person classes operating out of private residences be required to implement the TraceTogether-only SafeEntry system?
    content: |
      As with tuition and enrichment centres (see Q11), private tutors providing in-person classes operating out of private residences will need to implement TT-only SafeEntry.

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions provide food and drinks to students?
    content: |
      In line with the prevailing safe management measures, food and drinks should not be provided. Students should keep their masks on at all times, and not consume any food and drinks during classes, as far as possible.

      If necessary, for exxample, during full day workshops or courses, students may bring their own packed food, and consume the food and drinks, subject to additional safe management measures in Q2 and Q3 as applicable.

      These additional safe management(please refer to Q3) measures also apply for classes that require the consumption of food and beverage as part of the class (e.g. dining etiquette classes). 

  - title: Can private tuition/enrichment classes and training sessions involving transient mask-off activities such as food tasting be allowed to continue?
    content: |
      Students are strongly encouraged to keep their masks on throughout class as much as possible. If necessary as part of the lesson, transient mask-off activities such as food tasting are allowed, subject to additional safe management measures specified in Q1.

  - title: I am a private provider / Allied Health Professional offering services for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or disabilities. May I provide services and what are the safe management measures that I need to adhere to?
    content: |
      For Early Intervention (EI) services provided to pre-school children (aged 0 - 6), please refer to ECDA's guidelines on EI services.  

      In addition to aligning with MOH guidelines on healthcare services, group therapy for all non-public Healthcare Institutions AHS, including psychology services, is capped at a maximum of 5 clients per session (count excludes AHPs and support staff).
