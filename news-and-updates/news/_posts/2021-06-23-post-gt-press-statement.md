In a press statement released by Government Technology Agency (GovTech) on 23 June 2021, the Agency announced an increase in government spending on info-communications technology (ICT) procurement to an estimated S$3.8 billion in FY2021, with the aim to accelerate Government digitalisation.

An estimated S$2.7 billion (70 per cent out of S$3.8 billion) will be spent on 250 projects to transform, integrate and streamline digital services across different sectors to create a more digitally empowered nation. 

GoBusiness was highlighted as one of the key projects that will undergo transformation. Currently, the GoBusiness platform has helped a monthly average of 150 Food and Beverage establishments register for licences, with a shorter turnaround time. The platform will be expanded into a place for business-to-government interactions in Singapore and provide personalised assistance and recommendations for new and existing business.
