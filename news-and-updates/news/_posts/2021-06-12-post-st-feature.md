The article titled “Website simplifies licensing process for business owners” reported in The Straits Times on 12 June 2021 featured various Food and Beverage (F&B) business owners who have benefited from the simplified licensing process enabled by GoBusiness.
The platform consolidates the licences required by F&B businesses so that business owners no longer need to approach different government agencies to make applications. Payments can also be made online via GoBusiness, making the entire process seamless for users.

The GoBusiness website receives about 240,000 visits per month, and more than 2,300 food service businesses have since benefited from the platform.

Director of Operations at Sing Swee Kee Chicken Rice, Ms Eliss Pang, said that the GoBusiness feature which recommends related licences required is especially useful for new F&B businesses, since there may be licences that new business owners are not aware of.

Mr Regan Hee, who runs healthfood minimart Harvester and three Poke Theory franchise branches, shared that GoBusiness has empowered him to manage licence applications without having to engage an external consultant. He added that the waiting time for a licence approval can be shortened to three days from 30 days with GoBusiness, and users can log in to check the status of their applications at any time.
