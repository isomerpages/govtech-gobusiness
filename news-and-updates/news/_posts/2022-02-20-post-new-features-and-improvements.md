For users looking to start a new business, these features can help ensure a smooth transition:

**Step-by-step-guidance**
With the new [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, users can answer a few questions to generate their very own Guided Journey - a detailed walkthrough for each step in registering a business before completing the registration process, all on GoBusiness. Each application form also comes with a summary of essential information and required documents to guide first-time business owners. Users can also read the Start-up Guide first for a clearer idea on what to prepare.

**Brand name availability**
The e-Adviser for Starting a Business allows users to see whether their brand name is available as a trademark, social media handles, and more.

**Wide range of e-Advisers**
GoBusiness has an e-Adviser for every step of the process for new business owners. Users can start out by choosing the most suitable business structure with the [e-Adviser for Business Structure](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/businessstructure/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, then find out their next steps and apply directly with the e-Adviser for Starting a Business<sup>*</sup>.

They can also use the [e-Adviser for Premise Use](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/premisesusecheck?src=start_using_commercial_space/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to check if their premises are currently approved for the intended use, or even find out which licences to apply for with this directory of [e-Advisers for Licences](/licences/find-licence-by-sector/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

<sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

**Full integration with the GoBusiness Dashboard**
After using the e-Adviser for Starting a Business, users can stay updated on the status of their applications<sup>*</sup> and follow up on the next steps via the GoBusiness dashboard.

<sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

### A more seamless way to government assistance

It is now even easier to find and apply for the relevant government assistance schemes with these enhancements to the [e-Adviser for Government Assistance](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/govassist/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} :

**Improved recommendations**
Thanks to an enhanced interface, users will find the e-Adviser for Government Assistance easier to use and more helpful than ever. They can now also select sub-sectors for more specific and relevant recommendations.

**Auto-filled forms**
With just one simple login via Singpass, forms can be auto-filled with usersâ€™ company information from their Unique Entity Number (UEN) profiles, for a faster and smoother application process.

**Easy integration with Business Grants Portal (BGP)**
Upon getting their e-Adviser results, any recommended BGP grant comes with a direct link to the relevant page on BGP to apply, without requiring users to log in again. Business grant applications made more efficient, with less time spent navigating different websites.

### A fresh look and exciting new content
