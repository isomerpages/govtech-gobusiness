## An enhanced GoBusiness experience

Enjoy an even more integrated and seamless experience on GoBusiness with a brand new GoBusiness Dashboard, new and improved e-Advisers, and more! Here's what you can expect:

### An all-new GoBusiness Dashboard

The new GoBusiness Dashboard is now available, and it is packed with features that enable users to:

**Find everything in one place** Users can now apply for, renew and cancel business licences, all on the GoBusiness Dashboard.

**Get a bird's eye view of all business transactions** The dashboard is neatly organised into simple categories such as "My Licences" and "My Tasks" so users can easily obtain an overview of all their ongoing applications and transactions at a glance.

### Personalised guidance for new business owners

For users looking to start a new business, these features can help ensure a smooth transition:

**Step-by-step-guidance** Users just have to answer a few questions on the [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, to generate their very own Guided Journey - a detailed walkthrough for registering a business before completing the registration process, all on GoBusiness. Each application form also comes with a summary of essential information and required documents to guide first-time business owners. Users can also read the [Start-up Guide](/start-a-business/?src=news) to obtain a clearer idea on what to prepare.

**Brand name availability** The e-Adviser for Starting a Business allows users to see whether their brand name is available as a trademark, social media handles, and more.

**Wide range of e-Advisers available** GoBusiness has an e-Adviser to guide new business owners at every step of the way. Users can start out by finding out the most suitable business structure for their business using the [e-Adviser for Business Structure](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/businessstructure/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} before embarking on the business registration process using the [e-Adviser for Starting a Business](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/startabusiness/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}<sup>*</sup>.

They can also use the [e-Adviser for Premise Use](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/premisesusecheck?src=start_using_commercial_space/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} to check if their premises are currently approved for the intended use, or even find out which licences to apply for with this directory of [e-Advisers for Licences](/licences/find-licence-by-sector/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

###### <sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

**Full integration with the GoBusiness Dashboard** After using the e-Adviser for Starting a Business, users can stay updated on the status of their business registration<sup>*</sup> and follow up on the next steps via the GoBusiness dashboard.

###### <sup>*</sup>This currently applies only to sole proprietorships and partnerships.

### Seamless access to government assistance

It is now even easier to find and apply for the relevant government assistance schemes with these enhancements to the [e-Adviser for Government Assistance](https://eadviser.gobusiness.gov.sg/govassist/?src=news){:target="\_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}:

**Improved recommendations** With an enhanced interface, it is now easier to navigate the e-Adviser for Government Assistance. Users can also select sub-sectors for more specific and relevant recommendations.

**Auto-filled forms** With just one simple login via Singpass, application forms can be auto-filled with the user company information obtained from the UEN profile, for a faster and smoother application process.

**Seamless integration with Business Grants Portal (BGP)** Upon getting their e-Adviser results, any recommended BGP grant comes with a direct link to the relevant page on BGP to apply, without requiring users to log in again. Users can now cut down on time spent  navigating different websites.

### A fresh look and exciting new content
