## Change in Corppass login

![corpass](/images/news/News_Change login.jpg)

From 11 April 2021, government digital services for businesses (G2B) will require a login via Singpass instead of Corppass.

### Why the change?

Having a single Singpass login system, instead of maintaining two separate modes of identity authentication, simplifies the user experience of managing multiple sets of login credentials of corporate transactions. This not only improves convenience for users but also streamlines system operations.

### Do I still need my Corppass account?

Corppass will continue to be the one-stop authorisation system for businesses to authorise or remove their employees' access to government digital services on their behalf. Your Singpass ID will have been automatically linked to your Corppass account, so you can sign in via Singpass.

### I am an existing Foreign ID user on Corppass. How do I log in now?

Foreign ID users will be issued a Singpass Foreign user Account (SFA) and the â€˜Corppass 2FA for Foreigners' app will no longer be used.
