## New GoBusiness feature: e-Advisers for licences

![licences-eadviser](/images/news/News_Licensing eAdviser launch.jpg)

GoBusiness has launched e-Advisers for Licences, a new feature to help users find out which licences they need, and apply for them.

### What are e-Advisers?

[e-Advisers](/e-services/guides-for-biz/) are a free and handy tool for business owners to understand their needs better. To use it, business owners answer a series of questions about their business. The e-Adviser will then provide recommendations, based on the answers given.

### Find licence guides by sector

With a wide variety of e-Advisers for different business activities, users can simply choose their business sector and use the relevant e-Adviser to find out which licences they need. The full list of e-Advisers for licences can be found in GoBusiness' [directory of licence guides](/licences/find-licence-by-sector/).
