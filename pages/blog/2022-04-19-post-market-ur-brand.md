Make your advertisements more catchy with a jingle or two! A [2016 study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pooja-Jain-21/publication/332320632_Study_of_the_Effectiveness_of_Advertising_Jingles/links/5cadbd73458515cd2b0d4e9e/Study-of-the-Effectiveness-of-Advertising-Jingles.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} found that 77.6 per cent of its respondents reported that their purchasing decisions were impacted by jingles. The use of jingles can enable listeners to [associate key marketing messages](https://blog.leightonbroadcasting.com/blog/the-importance-of-jingles-for-advertising-your-business#:~:text=As%20an%20advertising%20method%20that,what%20you%20have%20to%20offer.){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} with your brand in a memorable manner, creating an emotional bond with your target audience while leaving a lasting impression. 

Jingles such as Daikin Singapore’s [5 Ticks Smile Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG8THGUByNI){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} have become iconic earworms that have stayed with listeners, while consistently reminding them of key product attributes. The jingle underscores positive product attributes such as optimal energy efficiency, high cooling power, and ease of use through a catchy tune. . 

Don Don Donki’s jingle is yet another catchy tune that has caught on with consumers. WIth [lyrics](https://www.donki.com/miracle-shopping/assets/img/ms_dondondonki.pdf){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} that emphasise a positive shopping experience, the jingle is consistently played in-store, highlighting the emotional journey that customers undergo at their outlets. 

### 2. Explore new content formats

Exploring the latest visual content formats are key to keeping abreast with marketing trends. Why not try new short-form visual formats? Be it [TikTok videos](https://www.tiktok.com/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or [Instagram Reels](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-instagram-reels-announcement){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, getting in on what’s popular with today’s consumers can extend your reach to new audiences across various distribution channels. 

[Instagram Stories](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/instagram-stories){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} are a great way to gain creative insight into consumers’ preferences, via interactive functions such as Instagram Live, along with polls and quizzes that provide first-hand feedback from viewers.  

Branding videos can also provide an avenue to explore creative concepts that showcase your brand’s values and service offerings. This [2021 commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEc3iP9KN74){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} by Singapore Airlines, for example, captures the freedom of travel, appealing to consumers’ wanderlust. 

### 3. Leverage trends and seasonal occasions

Hopping onto the trendwagon is yet another way to keep your brand fresh. Food delivery platform foodpanda, for instance, referenced viral Netflix series Squid Game by showcasing a [recipe for Dalgona candy](https://www.tiktok.com/@foodpandasg/video/7011454612406373634?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, a Korean street food that was featured in the same show. Drawing inspiration from ongoing trends can be a good avenue to spark new and original ideas, while keeping up with what’s popular among consumers. 

Trends can also come in the form of social media challenges, which are commonly found on various social media platforms including Instagram and TikTok. 

### 4. Extend your brand reach through influencer marketing

Influencer marketing has been proven to improve brand awareness, as research has shown that consumers perceive endorsements from an influencer to be [“more trustworthy than a brand recommendation”](https://www.curemedia.com/increase-brand-awareness-influencer-marketing/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}. The influencer industry has seen [tremendous growth in recent years](https://www.getkobe.com/how-much-should-marketers-spend-on-influencer-marketing/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, with more businesses choosing to engage influencers to raise brand awareness. 

From micro-influencers to celebrities with larger online followings, partnering with influencers can be an effective way to reach out to specific target audiences, and foster a deeper connection with online communities. 

Collaborations with local influencers are also a good way to promote relatable content to your customer base and target market. Take musician and entertainer Benjamin Kheng’s [collaboration with insurance company AIA](https://www.facebook.com/Singapore.AIA/videos/360327652504420/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, in which he used his personal brand of humour to promote and engage viewers on a serious topic in a lighthearted manner, highlighting key benefits of the AIA Absolute Critical Cover plan through song. 

It’s important to adapt marketing strategies to fit the needs of your business. With the wide range of options available, don’t be afraid to get creative, explore new ideas, and find out what works best with consumers to further your brand!
