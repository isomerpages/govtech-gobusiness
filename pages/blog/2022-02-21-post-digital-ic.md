###### The Singpass Digital IC is a secure and convenient way to verify your customer’s identity, improving customer experience 

From garnering a wider reach through a digital presence, to maintaining productivity in an era of remote work – digitalisation has brought about many perks for businesses. 

But when it comes to identity verification, many are still going old school. Customers come with their physical ICs or drivers’ licences in hand, and businesses deal with unexpected interruptions if customers forget their documents. 

Well, digitalisation might have a solution for this too! 

### Introducing: Singpass Digital IC 

The [Digital IC](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/digital-ic/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} is a  digitised document of an individual’s identity, complete with personal information such as their name, identification number, photograph, date of birth, and other pertinent details. 

It can be accessed via the [Singpass app](https://www.singpass.gov.sg/main/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}, and serves as a way for business owners and organisations to have a secure and convenient means of identity verification. 

But is it really a better solution? Let’s find out! 

### 1. Greater convenience for businesses and customers 

The Digital IC can easily replace all the typical functions that otherwise necessitates a physical IC for face-to-face identity verification. For example, banks can use the Digital IC to verify an existing customer’s identity if they’re looking to set up an account, and telecommunications firms can do the same prior to the establishment of a phone line. Businesses may also use the Digital IC to register visitors or contractors who need to enter commercial buildings, as well as to verify prooff identity, such as at private gyms or for sales of age-restricted goods. 

This allows businessesto avoid futile appointments  where customers forget to bring identification along and are unable to proceed with a service. 

Better yet, both Singaporeans and long-term pass holders can be verified with the Digital IC. The latter group will find additional details displayed, including their pass status, pass expiry date and where relevant, the employer and sector.

On the flip side, customers too enjoy greater convenience. They can bid goodbye to carrying additional cards or their wallets, and enjoy shorter waiting times when identity verification is required. 

With the Digital IC, enjoy greater convenience, efficiency, and more happy customers!

### 2. Enhanced security against identity theft 

The Digital IC has in-built security protocols to ensure validity and protect the privacy of customers, and can actually provide greater security than physical ICs. 

For one, it uses an individual’s latest photograph as provided to the Government. This means easier identity verification as updated photos have a greater likeness to the individual, deterring identity theft. 

Businesses can also verify the authenticity of a Digital IC easily by checking for the animated lion crest with a holographic effect at the corner of a user’s photograph. This crest will help prevent image tampering and screenshot spoofing.

If the crest is absent or appears static, businesses will know if the identity shown is a screenshot. Besides the crest, businesses can also request for users to tap on their devices to verify that the presented credentials are indeed accessed via the Singpass app.

### 3. Improved privacy for customers

Unlike physical ICs where customers are required to hand over the physical document, the Digital IC gives customers autonomy over the information they share. For instance, most business transactions only require verification of information such as an individual’s full name, NRIC number/FIN, and latest photograph. 

Such information is accessible via the app’s front page. Meanwhile, further details such as date of birth, date of issue and the user’s residential address are only visible with user authentication. 

It should be noted that the Digital IC, like other personal information, are under the purview of the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA). 

This means that businesses should not download, print, or store recordings or screenshots of the Digital IC. However, business owners may record the particulars on their own systems after viewing the Digital IC if needed. 

For secure data collection, businesses may consider an API integration with Singpass [Verify](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/verify/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"} or [Myinfo](https://api.singpass.gov.sg/library/myinfo/business/introduction){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener"}.

### 4. Contactless identity verification for businesses

With the Digital IC, there is no longer a need for physical contact when p. All businesses need to do is view their customers’ information on the device’s screen,keeping both employees and customers safe. 
Accepting the Digital IC can give businesses a more convenient, secure, and contactless way for identity verification. This helps to streamline business processes and makes identity verification more intuitive for customers as well – a win-win for both parties!
