## 3D Intraoral Scanner

## Description

The Intraoral Scanner allows dentists to see detailed, 3D images of the patient's teeth and surrounding soft tissues. This allows generation of a digital dental impression quickly and accurately. The digital file can then be sent to dental labs for milling or printing of crowns/aligners. Digital impressions also enable dentists to conduct treatment outcome simulation, as well as data analysis.

Grant support: 80% of cost of equipment, up to $20,000 grant per unit.
