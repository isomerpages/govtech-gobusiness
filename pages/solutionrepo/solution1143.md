## Battery-Powered Rope Ascender

## Description

Access to intended in-situ work/inspection/repair locations onboard vessels are usually through the use of scaffolds or rope access operated manually.

The battery-powered rope ascender can help shipyard/workshop personnel ascend faster,  reduce physical strain on the body and take fewer rest breaks compared to the manual method. This would result in efficiency and productivity improvement.

Cost of equipment capped at $18,750 per unit
