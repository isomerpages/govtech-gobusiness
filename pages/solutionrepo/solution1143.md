### Description

Access to intended in-situ work/inspection/repair locations onboard vessels are usually through the use of scaffolds or rope access operated manually. The process is time-consuming and is physically exhausting. 

The battery-powered rope ascender can help shipyard/workshop personnel ascend faster,  reduce physical strain on the body and take fewer rest breaks compared to the manual method. This would result in efficiency and productivity improvement.
