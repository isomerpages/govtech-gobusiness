## Laser Geometric Alignment System

## Overview

**Description**

Geometric alignment and measurement are needed for shaft alignment, line bore applications, flatness/straightness measurement and machine tool alignment. Traditional alignment methods include visual inspection combined with a straight edge or use of dial indicators, which are inaccurate and time consuming. Laser geometric alignment systems are quick and easy to deploy, resulting in consistent and accurate results with minimal rework.

Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit
