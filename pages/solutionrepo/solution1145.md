### Description

Welding is usually carried out manually by welders or operators of an auto welding carriage. An auto welding carriage mounted to the side-wall can do multiple welding jobs at once, similar to a panel line system with 1 unit being the Master control while the remaining units (min. 2) follow suit using wireless communication. Production line with either 6 or 12 units will only require 1 to 2 welding operators per shift to operate the Master machine while monitoring the overall welding job.
