### Description

Battery-operated torque wrench or torque multiplier is a compact and portable tool used to apply specific torque to fasten nut, bolt, or lag screw. This eliminates the need of tedious manual torqing, or use of hydraulic/pneumatic torque equipment which requires additional power source, time and manpower to lay and connect cables/ hoses. With the portable, battery-operated torque wrench, a single worker will be able to carry out torquing independently and in a shorter amount of time.
