## Vacuum Packing and Sealing Machine

## Description

The vacuum packaging machine is used to vacuum seal products in a plastic wrap. Products already placed in plastic wrap are loaded into the vacuum chambers and the products will be vacuum sealed.
The alternative to this machine is for workers to manually seal products with cling packaging, without guarantees of a strong vacuum seal. It is recommended for the equipment to have a digital interface for ease of use.

Cost of equipment capped at $35,000 per unit
