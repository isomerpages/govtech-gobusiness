## Blast Chiller

## Overview

**Description**

By using fast-moving cold air, blast chiller rapidly lowers the temperature of food to prevent bacterial growth, thus lengthens the shelf life of prepared food. The rapid cooling process decreases the amount of ice crystals that appear on food, maintaining the quality and consistency of food products.

Cost of equipment capped at $37,500 per unit
