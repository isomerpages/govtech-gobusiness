Our company has a long history of servicing small and medium enterprises. Two of the main challenges constantly faced when working with SMEs are limited resources in financial and manpower.  

Proposal on changes to accounting processes and accounting solutions are usually met with reluctance due to capital expenditures and manpower to adapt to these new solutions.
