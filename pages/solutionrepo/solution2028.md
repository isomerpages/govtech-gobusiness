## WarelyPOS Version 11

## Description

WarelyPOS is a home-grown brand that aims to help F&B vendors go digital. We believe that all F&B vendors should have an alternate solution that could aid them to boost productivity for their business. Customized E-commerce websites would also be developed for our vendors. Deliveries are also made possible when using our software which help vendors to be less reliant on commission-based platforms and gain control over their costings.
