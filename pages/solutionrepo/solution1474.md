## Automatic Nut Splitter

## Description

The automatic nut splitter is used to cut through nuts within seconds. It is very useful for removing corroded nuts where a torque tool is unable to loosen the nut. It is also safer to operate as there are no open flames unlike using traditional torching. The risk of the operator injuring his hands is also lower as compared to using  a hammer and chisel. 

Cost of equipment capped at $7,500 per unit
